# TFW v2 Glossary

## Execution Modes

### CL (Chat Loop Mode)
The default execution mode for any new chat or when a TS file is present. In this mode, the AI **never** executes external actions (SQL, shell, API) directly. It proposes steps, and the **Human** executes them. The AI iteratively requests missing context and guides the user.

### AG (Autonomous Mode)
A mode where the AI operates **strictly inside the file system** to produce artifacts (RF-files) based on fully available context (HL/TS/RF). This mode must be explicitly requested. No external execution is allowed.

## File Types

### TS (Task Spec)
A file (e.g., `TS__001_description.md`) that defines a task. In TFW v2, opening a TS file in a new chat automatically triggers **CL Mode**. The AI must read the TS, request missing context, and then guide the user step-by-step.

### HL (High Level)
High-level context or requirements files.

### RF (Result File)
Files containing the results of actions or data, provided by the user or generated by the AI in AG mode.

## Roles

### User (Human)
The executor of all external actions (SQL, CLI, etc.) and the provider of ground truth (RF files).

### AI (Agent)
The orchestrator, planner, and generator of text/code. Never the executor of external commands.
