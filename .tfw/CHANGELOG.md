## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.5] — 2026-04-03
### Added
- **Human-Only Test** in RF.md, REVIEW.md, RES.md templates — FC quality gate: "would this fact be unknown without the human saying it?" Rejects agent-discoverable facts (TFW-18B)
- **Human-Only Test** in `knowledge.md` Phase 3 Step 1 — consolidation-time reject criterion for agent-discoverable facts (TFW-18B)
- **Quality bar** in RF.md §5 Observations + handoff.md §Observations — "report only issues that would bite the next developer" (TFW-18B)
- **Quality filter** in review.md Step 3 — reject filler observations before promoting to TECH_DEBT.md (TFW-18B)
- Knowledge consolidation bullet in `.tfw/README.md` §v3 additions (TFW-18B)
- `knowledge` and `config` rows in `.tfw/README.md` §Canonical Workflows table (TFW-18B)
### Changed
- FC prompt reframed from "next agent's behavior" to "strategic knowledge — domain patterns, stakeholder priorities, business context" in RF.md, REVIEW.md, RES.md templates (TFW-18B)
- FC prompt reframed in research.md §Closure and handoff.md §FC guidance (TFW-18B)
- conventions.md §10.1 category examples expanded: domain → revenue patterns/client segments, stakeholder → priorities/pain points/quotes, constraint → contractual obligations, context → market conditions/competitive landscape, risk → client concentration/knowledge silos (TFW-18B)
- knowledge.md Phase 2 gather guidance: "strategic knowledge" emphasis, redirects technical details to tfw-docs (TFW-18B)
- handoff.md FC guidance reordered: leads with "stakeholder priorities, domain patterns" instead of "environment, constraints" (TFW-18B)
- All adapters synced: `.agent/workflows/` (4 files) + `.claude/commands/` (3 files) (TFW-18B)

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-03
### Added
- `/tfw-config` workflow — interactive config sync with edit/verify modes and Config Sync Registry (16 mapped entries across 3 categories) (TFW-19)

- Inline budget table with Rationale column restored in `conventions.md` §6 (TFW-19)
- Inline limits table in `knowledge.md` §Limits — 4-row compact table (interval, gate_mode, max_facts, max_topics) (TFW-19)
- Budget Check enforcement hook in `plan.md` Phase 5 — mandatory check before writing TS (TFW-19)
- Multi-phase subfolder convention in `conventions.md` §4 — master artifacts at root, phase artifacts in `PhaseA/`, `PhaseB/` subfolders (TFW-19)
- Config Sync Registry term in `glossary.md` (TFW-19)
- `config.md` listed in `conventions.md` §8 Workflows and §15 Role Lock (TFW-19)

- All adapters synced: `tfw-plan.md`, `tfw-research.md`, `tfw-knowledge.md`, `tfw-config.md` (TFW-19)
### Deprecated

### Removed
- Naming Rules table from `plan.md` (~100 words) — already in `conventions.md` §4 (TD-48 resolved) (TFW-19)
### Fixed

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-03
### Added
- Conversation history scan instruction in `knowledge.md` Phase 2: Gather — consolidator MUST review chat history, not just artifact Fact Candidates (was never present — root cause of missed chat facts)

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-03
### Added
