## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-03
### Added
- Coordinator Mindset section in `plan.md` — quality of planning > speed of pipeline, anti-rush guidance, RESEARCH as default (TFW-17)
- Hard Rule #8 in `research.md` — every stage MUST include at least one external action (web search, URL read, docs) (TFW-17)
- Stage-level mindset reminders in `research.md` — 1-line blockquote at the start of Gather, Extract, Challenge (TFW-17)
- Depth self-check in `research.md` checkpoint template — "Did I use external sources, or only project files?" (TFW-17)
- External research bullet in Sufficiency Check — "Did every stage include external research?" (TFW-17)
- D21 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` — dual-lever fix for coordinator rush-bias + research depth (TFW-17)
- P9 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` — Coordinator Mindset principle (TFW-17)
### Changed
- `plan.md` Phase 1 — "Understand the problem" → "Understand the problem deeply" with anti-rush guidance (TFW-17)
- `plan.md` RESEARCH Gate — coordinator must be specific about what RESEARCH could reveal, frame as risk reduction (TFW-17)
- `research.md` Gather stage — "Autonomous search" replaced with "**Search externally**: how is this problem solved elsewhere?" (TFW-17)
- P8 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` — updated to include external tool mandate reference (TFW-17)
- All 4 adapter copies synced — `.agent/workflows/tfw-plan.md`, `.agent/workflows/tfw-research.md`, `.claude/commands/tfw-plan.md`, `.claude/commands/tfw-research.md` (TFW-17)
### Fixed
- TD-34: `research.md` L26 no longer references TS as primary output (confirmed resolved by TFW-14, verified TFW-17)
- Adapter desync: `.agent/workflows/tfw-plan.md` and `.claude/commands/tfw-plan.md` had stale `🔵 HL` statuses, `Phase 3.5` numbering, old pipeline diagram — all fixed via full copy from canonical

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-01
### Added
- `tfw.statuses` registry in `PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml` — 9 status entries with `role` field (TFW-15)
- Concept Taxonomy in `glossary.md` — 5 formal definitions: Document Type, Template, Workflow, Adapter Command, Status (TFW-15)
- REJECT branching in `conventions.md` — user decides: HL_DRAFT / RES / TS_DRAFT (TFW-15)
- D20 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` — pipeline status decoupling decision (TFW-15)
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Pipeline statuses renamed: `🔵 HL` → `📝 HL_DRAFT`, `🟡 TS` → `🟡 TS_DRAFT` across all `.tfw/` files (TFW-15)
- **BREAKING:** HL template status label: `🔵 HL — Ожидает ревью` → `📝 HL_DRAFT — Ожидает ревью` (TFW-15)
- **BREAKING:** TS template status label: `🟡 TS — Ожидает апрува` → `🟡 TS_DRAFT — Ожидает апрува` (TFW-15)
- `plan.md` — Phase 3.5 → Phase 4 (RESEARCH Gate), Phase 4 → Phase 5 (Decide Scope & Write TS), step numbering gap fixed (TFW-15)
- `research.md` — Status Transitions section updated to HL_DRAFT/TS_DRAFT (TFW-15)
- `conventions.md` — status table, pipeline diagram, REJECT verdict updated (TFW-15)
- `glossary.md` — Status Flow diagram updated (TFW-15)
- `.tfw/README.md` — Task Lifecycle pipeline diagram and REJECT wording updated (TFW-15)
### Deprecated
- `🔵 HL` and `🟡 TS` status names — replaced by `📝 HL_DRAFT` and `🟡 TS_DRAFT`
- `Phase 3.5` numbering in plan.md — replaced by clean Phase 4/5 numbering

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-01
### Added
- Briefing Protocol in `research.md` — mandatory entry with research plan, scope intent, guiding questions before stages (TFW-14)
- Closure Protocol in `research.md` — mandatory exit with HL update recommendations after sufficiency check (TFW-14)
- Briefing and Closure sections in `RES.md` template — structural anchors for agent behavior (TFW-14)
- 3 new Hard Rules in `research.md` — briefing mandatory, closure mandatory, sufficiency check with specifics (TFW-14)
- 4 new Anti-patterns — skip-briefing, rush-bias, silent closure, skip-bias (TFW-14)
- HL update gate in `plan.md` Phase 3.5 — coordinator reads RES → updates HL → user confirms → TS (TFW-14)
- D19 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` — HL update = mandatory RESEARCH output (TFW-14)
### Changed
- Checkpoint in `research.md` — extended with Stage Handoff (plan for next stage + question) (TFW-14)
- Final Checkpoint — Complexity Check replaced by Sufficiency Check ("sufficient for HL finalization?") (TFW-14)
- Turn-based rhythm — questions limit changed from "per stage" to "per turn" (≤3) across research.md, Limits table, Hard Rules, Anti-patterns (TFW-14)
- `plan.md` Phase 3.5 — skip-bias fix: pros/cons format, default=recommend research, user decides (TFW-14)
- Both adapters (`.claude/commands/tfw-research.md`, `.agent/workflows/tfw-research.md`) — synced with Briefing→Stages→Closure structure (TFW-14)
- Research Mindset L26 — reworded from "details needed for TS" to "refines the HL" (TFW-14 REVISE)
### Fixed
- TD-34: `research.md` L26 referenced TS as primary output after Closure Protocol addition — now references HL
