## [Unreleased]

Nothing pending.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-26

**Two people can now advance two tasks without meeting in the same file.** TFW-60 Phase A. Until this
release every lifecycle transition — create, plan, research, hand off, review, close — rewrote one table in
the root `README.md`. Task separation did not produce file separation: three participants working on three
unrelated tasks still queued behind one Markdown table, and its schema had already drifted (TD-177) while
the documentation build regex-read its columns as an implicit API (TD-81).

### ⚠️ Breaking

**The root Task Board is removed.** It was a required artifact; it no longer exists. Anything that parsed it
will find nothing to parse.

**Live state moved into each task.** `{task}/status.md` is now the only authority for a task's lifecycle,
owner, goal, value and terminal outcome. A transition is one write, inside one task directory.

**The status flow changed shape.** The lifecycle ids are unchanged, but `UNDECLARED` is added for a value a
migration source carried that the vocabulary does not contain. It is never selected by a person, and
normalizing it away is prohibited.

### Added

- **`{task}/status.md`** — the task state carrier. Closed key set, bounded fields, no free-text body, and
  every field has a named reader. Template: `.tfw/templates/status.md`.
- **`{task}/journal/`** — one immutable file per coordination event, named
  `<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>__<kind>__<actor>.md`. The filename *is* the event identifier, so nothing allocates one
  and nothing counts. **The actor is part of the name** because it is the only field that separates two
  concurrent writers — `on_behalf_of` names the same accountable person for both, and `via` names the same
  provider for two sessions of one tool. Two participants recording the same kind of event in the same second
  therefore produce two files rather than one; one actor writing twice in a second takes the next actual
  second. The time is read from the system clock and never typed. A written event is never edited; a
  correction is a new event. Entries carry references rather than copied artifact prose, under a **120 code
  point** summary ceiling — measured against 272 commit summaries and 63 review verdicts in this repository,
  where p95 is 83 and p99 is 110. Template: `.tfw/templates/journal_event.md`.
- **Three identity fields on every event** — `actor` (who performed it), `on_behalf_of` (who is accountable,
  always a human handle) and `via` (which tool produced it). An event without `on_behalf_of` is refused:
  there is no such thing as a record nobody answers for. A provider name is never an actor.
- **`team/{handle}.md`** — one profile per participant. Declared attribution, never authentication. The
  machine-to-handle binding lives outside the project tree, because a per-user file that is gitignored is
  still not sync-ignored. Template: `.tfw/templates/team_profile.md`.
  **No agent profile ships in 2.0.0.** The schema admits `type: agent` and the slot is deliberately empty: a
  provider family is not an actor, and what would make an agent profile meaningful — a named principal that
  delegates and answers to someone — is a separate task. Until then there is one accountable participant, and
  which tool produced a record survives in the event's `via` field.
- **A validation gate that reads task-local truth** — `python docs/scripts/gen_index.py --validate` checks
  every task's own state and journal against the closed schema. It is deliberately *not* a check that the
  shared index is current: requiring that would make every task-local transition fail until somebody rewrote
  the aggregate, which is the bottleneck this release removes.
- **`{container}/00-INDEX.md`** — a derived portfolio view, rebuilt by `python docs/scripts/gen_index.py`.
  It declares that it is derived, names its source count and freshness, and reports every unresolved input
  instead of dropping it. It is never authoritative: a workflow acting on a task re-reads that task's
  `status.md` first, and an absent or stale index degrades discovery without changing any task.
- **`tfw.task_containers`** — an ordered list. A task is created in the first entry and resolved by
  searching every entry in order.
- **Clock-derived identifiers** — `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS__slug`, and **the whole directory name is the
  identifier**. The timestamp alone is not one: two participants offline from each other can reach the same
  second, and only the slug tells them apart. Same second *and* same slug means they created the same task —
  a signal, not a collision. Creating a task reads no counter and no other task directory; if the directory
  already exists, the writer takes a new actual timestamp under a bounded retry, never a reuse, and a clock
  that will not advance fails visibly instead of spinning.
- `docs/scripts/gen_index.py` and `docs/scripts/migrate_board.py`, with tests.

### Changed

- The root `README.md` carries a permanent route to the index and no live task table.
- Lifecycle workflows — `plan`, `research`, `handoff`, `review`, `resume`, `release`, `init` — read and write
  task state instead of the board.
- The status legend moved from the README to `.tfw/glossary.md` § Status Flow, where the vocabulary already
  lived.
- Templates use `{ID}` where they used `{PREFIX}-{N}`: both identifier grammars are readable everywhere.

### Fixed

- **TD-81** — the documentation generator no longer regex-reads board columns. A test now fails if a
  board-shaped table regex is reintroduced into `docs/scripts/`.
- **TD-177** — the board's schema cannot drift, because there is no board.

### Migration

**One setting decides the layout.** `tfw.task_containers` is a list. A new project sets one container. A
project with an existing corpus lists its old container second — that is one value with two entries, not two
supported layouts, and nothing else in the method changes.

```yaml
tfw:
  task_containers: [workspace, tasks]   # create in the first; resolve across all
```

**Nothing existing is renamed, moved or byte-changed.** Run
`python docs/scripts/migrate_board.py` for a dry run and read the accounting; run it with `--apply` to write.
It adds a `status.md` to each task still in flight and captures the board verbatim as
`tasks/BOARD-SNAPSHOT.md`. It opens no existing artifact in write mode and refuses to overwrite anything.

Renaming the old corpus into the new grammar was measured and refused: at this project's own migration the
old identifiers were carried by 7,505 references across 666 files and 271 commit subjects. A trace that needs
a translation table to be read has already lost the property the framework exists to provide.

**Then generate the view, and only then remove the board:**

```
python docs/scripts/migrate_board.py --apply
python docs/scripts/gen_index.py
# now delete the Task Board section from README.md and put the route in its place
```

That order matters. The project must never be without a portfolio view.

**What is not in this release.** Transport — whether a project collaborates through Git or through file
synchronization — is a declared project mode owned by a separate task. Nothing here requires a daemon,
database, lock server, vendor API or MCP host, and nothing here is required for a task to be read or
advanced: with the generator deleted, tasks stay readable and workable and only discovery degrades.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-08-18

**A failed task can finally be closed as failed.** TFW-53 Phase E, the last phase of the contract work.
The status set could record success, work in flight and waiting — and nothing could record failure, so the
only ways to close a failed task were to lie with `✅ DONE`, misuse `❌ BLOCKED`, or delete the folder. This
project did the third: a whole-tree restore took `README.md` back to a state that had never contained two
rejected tasks' rows, and the failure status they carried disappeared as a side effect of the method. Nobody
decided it, and no rule was broken — which is why this release ships a rule rather than a reminder.

**Why `REJECTED` and not `BLOCKED`.** `❌ BLOCKED` was defined, listed and available at the moment the
rejected task closed, and the coordinator declined it and hand-wrote a token the framework did not have.
`BLOCKED` has 0 occurrences across 46 Task Board rows. The two states are different: blocked is waiting and
resumes; rejected is closed and keeps its trace. `REJECTED` is also the only candidate name carrying a
collision, and it was kept anyway — every alternative (`FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `ABANDONED`, `DROPPED`)
presupposes the *reason*, and the reason belongs in the board row's description.

### Added
- **`❌ REJECTED` as a terminal task status** — the status set could record success, waiting and work in flight, but never failure, so closing a failed task meant misusing `✅ DONE`, misusing `❌ BLOCKED` (which means waiting) or deleting the folder. Present in `conventions.md` §5 (table and transition diagram, drawn as a side node reachable from any status), `project_config.yaml`, `templates/project_config.yaml`, `glossary.md` `## Status Flow` and the README legend. Terminal — no status follows it. It is a **task status**, distinct from the review verdict `❌ REJECT` and from the HL §12 amendment verdict of the same name; neither of those is terminal (TFW-53/E)
- **`conventions.md` §13 — reverting a result does not revert its trace.** A rejected task's folder and its board row are never deleted: the work may leave the working tree, the record that the work happened stays (TFW-53/E)
- **`conventions.md` §14 anti-pattern — a whole-tree restore reverts the Task Board past a task's failure status.** Restoring every file to an older tree also restores rows to a state that never contained the newer ones, so the loss happens silently and nobody decides it (TFW-53/E)

### Changed
- **`glossary.md` `### Amendment Log`** — one clause separating the HL §12 amendment verdict `❌ REJECTED` from the new terminal task status of the same name. The collision is stated at both ends, so whichever file an agent opens first it learns there are two (TFW-53/E)

### Notes for upgrading projects
- **Additive only.** `/tfw-update` brings one new entry in `tfw.statuses`, one row and one diagram node in `conventions.md` §5, one sentence in §13, one anti-pattern in §14, and two `glossary.md` edits. No status was renamed, no transition redrawn, no template field changed, no file removed. A board that never used `❌ BLOCKED` and never needs `❌ REJECTED` is unaffected.
- **The status also lands in `templates/project_config.yaml`**, so a newly initialised project is *born* with it rather than acquiring it by upgrade.
- **Version note.** `RELEASE.md` §3 lists *"status flow changed"* under MAJOR. This change adds a state and alters no existing one; `docs/scripts/gen_docs.py` parses board rows by regex with no hardcoded status set, and 68 tests pass unchanged. Released as MINOR on the impact test, by owner decision — the same standard applied at 1.1.0, where §3's *"required file removed"* clause also over-classified an additive-in-effect change. **Second occurrence of the same misfire; recorded as tech debt against §3.**

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-14

**An approved HL becomes a contract, and the reviewer becomes its defender.** Phases A–D of TFW-53 in
one entry. Phase E (rejected-task trace restoration) is independent and not in this release.

**Why it exists.** An inviolable contract with a defender is the precondition for delegation: releasing
a coordinator to run a team of agent sessions is only safe once the goals cannot move and something
checks the result against them. That delegation mode is **TFW-54**, deliberately a separate task —
building both at once splits the coordinator's focus, which is the failure this work exists to prevent.

### Added
- **HL Contract** — on owner approval, `templates/HL.md` §1, §3, §4, §5, §6 and §7 freeze; §2, §7.2 and §8–§11 stay free; §12 becomes append-only. Carried by a header `Contract` field with two states, which tracks the *artifact* where task status tracks the *pipeline*. The frozen unit is the declarative claim, not the section text. `conventions.md` §3 owns the 21 rules, including the requirement that the approved HL be **committed before the first research iteration** — an uncommitted baseline makes "frozen" permanently unverifiable (TFW-53/A, TFW-48 precedent)
- **`§12 Amendment Log`** — the only channel for changing a frozen claim: a dated, evidenced proposal carrying cost and a considered alternative, ruled by an explicit owner verdict. Append-only, so a refused proposal stays visible as an attempt. `Type` states relation to the baseline (`EXTEND` / `SUPERSEDE` / `RESTRICT`), never disposition. `templates/RES.md` splits its recommendations to match: `Refinements` the coordinator applies, `Amendment Proposals` it may not (TFW-53/A)
- **Purpose Check** — `templates/review/judge.md` row 2 clause (a) asks *is this what we set out to do?* against the **contract baseline plus the Project North Star**, never the TS and never a Phase HL. One field quotes the clause served **and** names the concrete harm; a citation that resolves but is irrelevant fails the row, and so does a harm asserted with no citation. Three tests — excess and adjacency, deferral confession, materiality. Three outcomes: aligned, **`not fit for purpose`** (grounds ❌ REJECT with every other check passing, routed to the owner), and *reference set internally inconsistent* (a contract defect, also to the owner). *"The TS scoped it this way"* and *"tests are green"* are named as insufficient grounds to approve (TFW-53/C)
- **PV Index priority 0 — Project North Star** — an anchor above the task HL, answering what we are building, why, and **what we are deliberately not building**. Locus: designated section(s) of a README, never a task HL. Optional, with a declared fallback to master HL §1 at its contract baseline, so a review is never blocked on its absence. `templates/HL.md` gains a `Project North Star` header field. Citation namespace `NS{n}`; `PP{n}` for a project principle registry; HL §7 `P{n}` unchanged (TFW-53/C)
- **Ten glossary articles** — `HL Contract`, `Contract Baseline`, `Frozen Section`, `Amendment`, `Amendment Log`, `Project North Star`, `Purpose Check`, `not fit for purpose` and `Deferral confession` under a new `## Contract and Purpose Defence` grouping, plus the long-missing `Result Visualization` beside `Value Flow` and `Findings Map`. Eight of the ten had zero definitions while five files used them (TFW-53/D)
- **Anti-patterns in `conventions.md` §14** — silent frozen-section edits, unclassified research recommendations, applying an amendment before its verdict, research on an uncommitted baseline, a research-thread remark treated as a verdict, an agent citing its own delegation to accept an overrun, a Phase HL authoring its own acceptance criteria or principles, a reviewer approving work that satisfies the TS but not the contract, and alignment asserted without citing the clause it serves (TFW-53/A, /C)

### Changed
- **`plan.md` Step 6c is inverted** — from *"Update HL with research findings (present diff to user)"* to *classify, apply, log, escalate*: refinements applied silently, amendments transcribed into §12 as `PROPOSED` with the section left untouched, and one batched escalation per iteration carrying evidence, cost and alternative. A coordinator may not apply a proposal it filed. Both verdict paths are specified, including a **re-freeze commit at the new baseline** after every approved amendment (TFW-53/B)
- **`research/base.md`** — the researcher classifies every recommendation by target section and never edits the HL (TFW-53/B)
- **Reviewer Identity** — *"Quality guardian, not rubber stamp"*, extended to name the third defended object: goals, values and the north star, with authority to block work that is verified, complete and beside the point. D46 recorded the *"not rubber stamp"* half in April and only the first half ever shipped (TFW-53/C, D46)
- **`review.md`:28 loads the master HL at its contract baseline**, not the current file — without this the reference-set rule has nothing to bind to and reviewers keep reading the drifted version (TFW-53/C)
- **`conventions.md` §5 REJECT branch (a)** — *"rework HL"* now means *file an amendment against the frozen sections*; re-entry to `📝 HL_DRAFT` reopens the free sections only. It was the one documented path that reopened a frozen contract with no proposal and no log (TFW-53/A)
- **`conventions.md` §3 — a Phase HL is derivation-only.** It may restate master content and add execution context; it may not carry its own §1, §5, §6 or §7. TFW-48's Phase A HL was a complete second contract that silently dropped three master principles (TFW-53/A)
- **`templates/HL.md` §3.1 — Working Backwards and visualization are mandatory**, not format options: written from the finished state, rendered visually with prose alone insufficient, showing the value and not only the artifact, and complete enough for a multi-phase task to be held at once (TFW-53/A)
- **One name per concept** — `frozen baseline` and `committed frozen baseline` retire in favour of **`Contract Baseline`**; the `templates/HL.md` north-star field label becomes **`Project North Star`**, so the form teaches the name the glossary defines (TFW-53/D, D28)
- **Scope budgets raised to the owner's working values** — `max_files_per_phase` 14 → **30**, `max_new_files` 8 → **15**, `max_loc` 1200 → **3000**, `max_modified_files` 12 → **30**. Changed in both places that carry the numbers: `templates/project_config.yaml` (what a new project is born with) and `conventions.md` §6 (the defaults table agents read inline). Rationale: the standard is set by observed practice, not by the shipped template — the owner's project had run at these values for months while the template still claimed the old ones, so an upgrade would have silently reverted them. Owner instruction, 2026-08-13. See D62
- **Adapter Sync section completed** — `workflows/config.md`. It documented 4 of 11 workflow files and 1 of 3 adapter folders; it now carries the full source → copy mapping for both full-copy folders (`.claude/commands/`, `.agent/workflows/`), an explicit *not copied, and why* table (research mode files, the adapter-only `tfw-task`, Codex thin routers), and a runnable **drift check** that prints every copy no longer matching its source. Two anti-patterns added: copying to one adapter folder only, and reporting a sync as done without running the check. At Phase D the check printed **14 drifted copies** (7 workflows × 2 folders); all fourteen were re-synced and the check now runs silent (TFW-53/D)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — the `/tfw-plan` and `/tfw-review` purpose cells describe what those workflows now do, and the table gains the two rows it was missing, `/tfw-knowledge` and `/tfw-config` (TFW-53/D)

### Removed
- **The Judge mapping-integrity check** — *"did the AC each HL §7 principle was mapped to pass?"* It is structurally unable to detect a principle violated by the mapping itself: in a reconnaissance corpus it returned ✅ on the very acceptance criterion that carried the violation, and the reviewer later retracted his own APPROVE. Replaced by the Purpose Check above; row 2 clause (b) design soundness is unaffected (TFW-53/C)
- **`templates/RES.md`:32 — `<!-- List what should change in HL based on research. Coordinator applies these. -->`** The template-side twin of `plan.md` Step 6c. Fixing one and not the other would have reproduced the drift through the second channel (TFW-53/A)
- **The inline baseline recovery command in `templates/HL.md`** — a fourth copy of `git log --format=…` in the template every HL is born from, replaced by a pointer to `conventions.md` §3 rule 15 so it can be corrected in one place. **Upgrading projects: existing HL headers keep whatever they carry** — history is not rewritten; the change affects HLs created from this version onward (TFW-53/D, TD-164)
- **`KNOWLEDGE.md` §0 from `compilable_contract.md`'s *"Where references appear"* list** — a section D37 removed in April (TFW-53/D, TD-167)

### Fixed
- **`compilable_contract.md`** — `NS{N}` and `PP{N}` were declared in the §2 pattern table with no resolution behaviour; they now sit in the Resolution rules beside `D{N}`, `P{N}`, `F{N}` and `TD-{N}` (TD-165)
- **`glossary.md`** — the Knowledge Gate is in **Step 2** of `plan.md`, not a "Phase 0" that does not exist (TD-163)
- **Adapter parity restored** — both `tfw-plan` copies still carried the retired *"Update HL with research findings"*, so two of three surfaces instructed the coordinator to do what the core now forbids (TD-157). Six further workflows were repaired in the same pass: `tfw-init`, `tfw-handoff`, `tfw-update`, `tfw-knowledge`, `tfw-review`, `tfw-research`

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-13
### Added
- **Three promoted universal Judge rows** — `templates/review/judge.md` grows from 7 to 10 rows, each promoted row carrying its measured non-✅ rate from a 637-row / 203-review / 3-install corpus: **Evidence sufficiency** (16.1% — the highest-firing check in TFW review; four gated rows turned out to be one check in three genre costumes), **Backward compatibility** (8.5%), **Safety** (4.0%, retained on consequence rather than frequency). Row 2 *Philosophy aligned* is sharpened into two separately answered clauses — mapping integrity and **design soundness** (4.5%) (TFW-56, D42 revoked)
- **Structural explicit-N/A grammar in the Judge checklist** — status vocabulary is `✅ / ❌ / ⚪ N/A`, and `⚪ N/A` requires a stated reason. A row skipped as a bare ✅ leaves the stage incomplete. Rows 7 and 8 carry an explicit contrast note (*does the evidence exist* vs *does it establish the claim*) plus a Checkpoint item requiring they be answered separately (TFW-56, F21)
- **Claim & Source Checks in `templates/review/verify.md`** — the three `docs`/`spec` verify actions promoted to unconditional: spot-check 2-3 key claims or sources, confirm every citation traces to a real artifact, verify data claims against a primary source. Table + Checkpoint item; feeds Judge row 8 (TFW-56)
- **Anti-pattern in `conventions.md` §14** — a review checklist row added without an evidenced firing rate. Retention on consequence rather than frequency is permitted and must be written into the row (TFW-56)
### Changed
- **`review.md` steps renumbered 0-7, contiguous** — Step 0 is Session Naming, the TFW standard this file never followed. Map 2→1, Verify 3→2, Judge 4→3, Decide 5→4, Tech Debt 6→5, Update Traces 7→6, Knowledge Capture 8→7. The Verify step now states that every action in `verify.md` is unconditional and that depth is set by `min_verify_ratio`, never by the kind of work under review (TFW-56, TD-106 closed by deletion)
- **`templates/REVIEW.md` §3 realigned row-for-row with `judge.md`** — ten rows in the same order. This also repairs a pre-existing gap: the Evidence completeness row added to `judge.md` in 0.8.8 had never reached `REVIEW.md` §3 (TFW-56)
- **`glossary.md`** — Reviewer heading is *"coordinator under the reviewer Role Lock"*, so the phrase "review mode" no longer carries two meanings (D28); entry describes one universal 10-row checklist; Principles Check pointer corrected to `review.md` Step 3 (TFW-56)
- **`workflows/config.md`** — the `review` propagation section keeps only `min_verify_ratio`, whose step pointer is correct in the renumbered workflow (TFW-56)
- All adapter copies re-synced: `.claude/commands/tfw-{review,config}.md`, `.agent/workflows/tfw-{review,config}.md`, `.tfw/adapters/codex/skills/tfw-review/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/tfw-review/SKILL.md` (TFW-56, D54)
### Removed
- **Config key `tfw.review.default_mode`** — removed from `.tfw/project_config.yaml` and `.tfw/templates/project_config.yaml`. **Upgrading projects: this key is now inert.** `/tfw-update` triages files, not keys, so a leftover `default_mode: code` line will not be flagged and will not break anything — delete it from your `tfw.review` block. `tfw.review.min_verify_ratio` and its `0.42` default are unchanged (TFW-56)
- **Review mode files** — `.tfw/workflows/review/{code,docs,spec}.md` and the folder itself. Byte-identical across three installs, two framework versions and two product domains; never used as an extension point. Their first verify action duplicated `verify.md`'s Checkpoint (TFW-56, D42 revoked)
- **The review mode selection step and its 🛑 WAIT gate** — `review.md` Step 1. In 203 mode-carrying reviews no mode row was ever the sole non-✅ driving a verdict: the rows carried signal at ~8%, the selection in front of them flipped nothing. What to check is declared once, by the TS — acceptance criteria (D49) and `Evidence:` fields (D52) (TFW-56)
- **`Mode:` / `Review Mode` template fields** — from `templates/review/{map,verify,judge}.md` and `templates/REVIEW.md`, together with the mode-specific placeholder comment. Existing REVIEW files keep their headers; history is not rewritten (TFW-56)
- **`docs` Content quality checklist row** — dropped rather than promoted; the one true duplicate of universal row 4 *Style & standards* (TFW-56)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-06
### Added
- **Minimal Commit Attribution** — AI-authored commits use the searchable `[agent/task/scope/role] summary` subject format with explicit field meanings and a clear separation from Git author/committer metadata and actor authentication (TFW-50, D55)
### Changed
- **Commit subject contract (breaking)** — Coordinator, Researcher, Executor, and Reviewer use the conventions-owned format when they create commits; the rule formats existing commit actions and creates no commit cadence
- **Handoff and release publication boundary** — ONB and release commits use Commit Attribution, while push and remote tag publication remain unavailable until explicit user approval

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-22
### Added
- **Evidence Enforcement** — `evidence/` folder mandatory in every task directory. EV template (`.tfw/templates/evidence/EV.md`) with Environment header, per-AC evidence table (4-status vocabulary), Verdict line, optional Attachments index. Naming: `EV__{PREFIX}-{N}__{title}.md`. D16 (optional folder) revoked; D53 (TFW-47/A)
- **Codex first-class adapter** — 11 handwritten shortcut skills in `.tfw/adapters/codex/skills/tfw-*/SKILL.md`, installed to `.agents/skills/tfw-*/SKILL.md`. Two-layer architecture: root AGENTS.md always-on recognition (`TFW:CODEX` marker block) + repo-local skills for discovery and progressive loading. D54 (TFW-47/B)
- **Codex adapter README** — executable install/repair contract: detect state → install copies → merge AGENTS block → remove legacy → verify → runtime contract (TFW-47/B)
- **Codex in init.md** — Phase 0 full-init vs existing-project attach/repair detection, Codex skill install and verification steps (TFW-47/B)
- **Codex in update.md** — safe command/routing re-sync with marker ownership, legacy cleanup guard, literal slash smoke test (TFW-47/B)
- **Evidence subfolder section in conventions.md** — §4 documents `evidence/` as mandatory subfolder alongside `research/` and `review/` (TFW-47/A)
### Changed
- **RF template §5** — inline evidence table replaced with pointer to EV file + verdict summary. Cognitive mode clarified: executor's observational work lives in EV file (TFW-47/A)
- **TS template** — added `### Evidence Artifacts` subsection after AC items with guidance and example table (TFW-47/A)
- **handoff.md Step 11** — rewritten with 6 numbered substeps for evidence folder creation, template copy, and population. Skip condition removed — evidence always required (TFW-47/A)
- **conventions.md §3** — evidence pipeline table updated: EV file row added, RF row clarified as "Summary / Reference" (TFW-47/A)
- **conventions.md §14** — evidence anti-pattern wording strengthened: "evidence/ folder" language, "VERIFIED without artifact" prohibition (TFW-47/A)
- **glossary.md** — Adapter Command entry includes Codex (`.agents/skills/tfw-*/SKILL.md`), Tool Adapter definition updated with two-layer Codex architecture (TFW-47/B)
- **conventions.md** — added Codex two-layer adapter pattern and cross-tool `/tfw-*` command contract (TFW-47/B)
- **quickstart.md** — Codex install/repair handoff, corrected lifecycle/four-role summary (TFW-47/B)
### Removed
- **Legacy `source-command-tfw-*` skills** — stale full-workflow imports that duplicated canonical workflows and created a second source of truth (TFW-47/B)

## [0.8.8] — 2026-07-07
### Added
- **Evidence Layer** — real-world verification as first-class TFW concept, separate from synthetic Verification (§4). Three-role pipeline: coordinator designs Evidence Plan (TS), executor collects evidence (RF §5), reviewer audits evidence (REVIEW). Fixed 4-status vocabulary: VERIFIED / DEFERRED / BLOCKED / N/A (TFW-46, D52)
- **Evidence concept in conventions.md** — §3 Evidence Sections table (4 per-template entries with cognitive modes), §12 evidence honesty rule, §14 five anti-self-deception anti-patterns (TFW-46/A)
- **Evidence field in TS template** — `Evidence:` field after `Gate:` in AC items with MAY-deviate instruction. Grammar: full spec, minimal, N/A, DEFERRED, or empty (TFW-46/A)
- **§5 Evidence section in RF template** — table (AC, What, Environment, Result, Artifact) + evidence verdict line. §5-8 renumbered to §6-9 (TFW-46/A)
- **Evidence Audit in review stage files** — judge.md check #7 (Evidence completeness), verify.md Evidence Verification section with table and N/A fallback (TFW-46/A)
- **Step 11 (Collect evidence) in handoff.md** — between build gate (Step 10) and Pre-RF Gate (Step 12). Proportionality clause, DEFERRED/BLOCKED guidance, proactive tooling note. §5 Evidence in mandatory sections (TFW-46/B)
- **Trust Protocol evidence entries in review.md** — 2 new entries: "Evidence: VERIFIED" (Verify level), "Evidence: N/A or no evidence" (Challenge level) (TFW-46/B)
- **Evidence reminder in plan.md** — Step 7 sub-step 3: coordinator considers Evidence fields when writing TS AC items (TFW-46/B)
- **5 Evidence glossary terms** — Evidence, Evidence Plan, Evidence Collection, Evidence Audit, Evidence Status Vocabulary (TFW-46/C)
### Changed
- **RF template renumbering** — §5 Observations → §6, §6 Fact Candidates → §7, §7 Strategic Insights → §8, §8 Diagrams → §9. All cross-references updated across templates, workflows, conventions (TFW-46/A)
- **glossary.md** — Strategic Insight entry: RF §7 → §8 (stale ref fix from Phase A renumbering) (TFW-46/C)
- All adapter copies synced: `.agent/workflows/tfw-{handoff,review,plan}.md`, `.claude/commands/tfw-{handoff,review,plan}.md` (TFW-46/C)

## [0.8.7] — 2026-05-01
### Added
- **Mindset blocks in research templates** — per-stage cognitive anchoring: Strategist (Briefing), Explorer (Gather), Analyst (Extract), Critic (Challenge). Each template has `> **Mindset:**` + `> **Test:**` blockquote between h1 and `> Parent:` line. Matches review template pattern (D41) (TFW-43)
- **Briefing h1 guiding question** — `# Briefing — "What should we investigate?"` added for consistency with other 3 stages (TFW-43)
### Changed
- **Copy-on-enter protocol** in `research/base.md` — Step 3 creates folder only (no template copy). Step 4 copies briefing template before writing. Step 5 restructured as FOR EACH loop: copy template → read Mindset → OODA → checkpoint → 🛑 STOP per stage. Restores D31 (file existence = stage completion) (TFW-43)
- All adapter copies synced: `.agent/workflows/tfw-research.md`, `.claude/commands/tfw-research.md` (TFW-43)
### Removed
- **Batch template copy** from `research/base.md` Step 3 — all 4 templates were copied at once, breaking D31 (file existence = stage completion) and observable progress. Replaced by copy-on-enter (TFW-43)

## [0.8.6] — 2026-04-30
### Changed
- **Research folder structure** — `researchN/` flat folders at task root replaced by single `research/` container with `iterN/` subfolders. RES files co-located with stage files (`research/iterN/RES.md`). `iterations.yaml` moved inside `research/` subfolder (TFW-42/A)
- **Stage file numbering** — `briefing.md`, `gather.md`, `extract.md`, `challenge.md` renamed to `1_briefing.md`, `2_gather.md`, `3_extract.md`, `4_challenge.md`. Sort order = execution order (TFW-42/A)
- **Phase folder naming** — `PhaseA/`, `PhaseB/` → `phase-a/`, `phase-b/` (kebab-case, consistent with D48) in conventions.md §4 and artifact filename table (TFW-42/A)
- **iterations.yaml schema** — added optional `agent` (free-text, traceability) and `sources` (list, source categories) fields. Backward compatible (TFW-42/A)
- **research/base.md** — Steps 0, 3, 4, 5, 6 updated: all paths use `research/iterN/`, numbered stage file names, co-located RES.md (TFW-42/B)
- **plan.md** — Step 6b: `research/iterations.yaml` path + `agent`/`sources` fields + multi-agent reference. Step 6c: updated RES paths. Step 7: `phase-a/` naming (TFW-42/B)
- **glossary.md** — "Iteration (Research)": `research/iterN/` paths, co-located RES. "iterations.yaml": `research/` location, `agent`/`sources` fields (TFW-42/C)
- All adapter copies synced: `.agent/workflows/tfw-{research,plan}.md`, `.claude/commands/tfw-{research,plan}.md` (TFW-42/C)
- D50 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` §1, TFW-42 in §2 (TFW-42)
- domain F4, philosophy F25, process F21-F22, stakeholder F2 in `knowledge/` topic files (TFW-42)

## [0.8.5] — 2026-04-20
### Added
- **Requirements-first TS template** — §4 Detailed Steps replaced by §5 Acceptance Criteria (verifiable gates with `[depends: AC-X]` dependency annotations), §3 Principles Check (HL §7 → AC mapping table), §6 Technical Guidance (reference, not instructions), §7 Definition of Failure (hard reject conditions), §9 Cross-Phase Modifications (multi-phase conflict tracker) (TFW-41/A, D49)
- **Pre-TS Gate** in `plan.md` Step 7 (3b) — coordinator reads RF of latest completed phase before writing next TS. Ensures planning against actual output, not prior plan (TFW-41/B, D49)
- **Pre-RF Gate** in `handoff.md` Step 11 — executor opens RF template and reads section headings before writing RF (TFW-41/B, D49)
- **Execution Loops** in `handoff.md` Phase 2 — when TS ACs have `[depends: AC-X]`, executor verifies prerequisite AC gate before implementing dependent AC (TFW-41/B, D49)
- **Session Naming Step 0** in `handoff.md`, `plan.md`, `review.md` — `Role | Task-ID | Phase` at session start (TFW-41/B, D49)
- **ONB answer protocol** in `handoff.md` — coordinator presents options with tradeoffs, does not decide for stakeholder (TFW-41/B, D49)
- **HL §7 Principles check** in `review.md` Judge stage — reviewer traces HL §7 → TS §3 → RF §3 for each principle (TFW-41/B, D49)
- **Phase Dependencies** section in HL template §4 — mermaid graph + dependency matrix for multi-phase tasks (TFW-41/A, D49)
- **Embedded dimensional analysis** in research templates — `## Dimensions` in gather.md, `## Configuration Space` in extract.md, `## Consistency Check` in challenge.md. Cross-stage structural dependency as natural enforcement (TFW-41/C, D49)
- **Dimensional analysis thread** in `research/base.md` Step 5 — 3-sentence connecting logic with graceful degradation for <3 dimensions (TFW-41/C, D49)
- **§14.1 Terminology Origin** in `conventions.md` — maintainer-facing note mapping TFW terms to Zwicky GMA equivalents (TFW-41/C)
- **4 anti-patterns** in `conventions.md` §14 — code-in-TS, coordinator planning drift, RF-from-memory, ONB source-less answers (TFW-41/A)
- **15 glossary terms** — 10 execution gate terms (Acceptance Criteria, Technical Guidance, Definition of Failure, Principles Check, AC Dependency Annotation, Execution Loop, Pre-TS Gate, Pre-RF Gate, Session Naming, Phase Dependencies) + 5 dimensional analysis terms (Dimension, Alternative, Configuration Space, Consistency Check, Surviving Configuration) (TFW-41/D)
- D49 in `KNOWLEDGE.md` §1, TFW-41 in §2, 2 legacy entries in §3 (TFW-41)
- philosophy F24 (instructions→compliance, heuristics→competence), process F18-F20 in `knowledge/` topic files (TFW-41)
### Changed

- **review.md** — Step 0 (Session Naming), step renumbering (Select Review Mode = Step 1), HL §7 Principles check in Judge. Line count 145→153 (TFW-41/B)
- **research/base.md** — dimensional analysis thread in Step 5. Line count 129→131 (TFW-41/C)
- **gather.md** — `## Dimensions` section before Findings. Line count 25→40 (TFW-41/C)
- **extract.md** — `## Configuration Space` section before Findings. Line count 25→42 (TFW-41/C)
- **challenge.md** — `## Consistency Check` section before Findings. Line count 25→47 (TFW-41/C)
- **glossary.md** — 2 new sections: `## Execution Gates` (10 terms), `## Research — Dimensional Analysis` (5 terms). Line count 197→246 (TFW-41/D)
- All Antigravity adapters synced: `.agent/workflows/tfw-{handoff,plan,review,research}.md` (TFW-41/D)
- philosophy F13 upgraded to ✅ verified (3 sources) with TFW-41 user quote on domain-agnosticism (TFW-41)
### Removed
- **TS §4 Detailed Steps** — procedural implementation instructions replaced by requirements-first Acceptance Criteria (TFW-41/A, D49)

## [0.8.4] — 2026-04-15
### Added
- **State/framework file classification** — §10.3 in conventions.md: 3-category model (Framework, State, Config) with lifecycle rules. State files NEVER overwritten from upstream (TFW-40/A, D47)
- **YAML naming convention** — §10.4 in conventions.md: `lower_snake_case` for all `.tfw/` YAML and template files. Uppercase reserved for root docs and `.tfw/` framework docs (TFW-40/B)
- **Templates for state/config files** — `.tfw/templates/knowledge_state.yaml` (clean `seq=0`), `.tfw/templates/project_config.yaml` (annotated `← PROJECT` / `← FRAMEWORK` markers) (TFW-40/A)
- **⚫ STATE category** in `update.md` — files never overwritten during `tfw-update` (knowledge_state.yaml, knowledge/, KNOWLEDGE.md, TECH_DEBT.md) (TFW-40/A)
### Changed
- `PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml` → `project_config.yaml` ⚠️ **BREAKING** — all references updated across workflows, templates, adapters, conventions, glossary, compilable_contract, README, KNOWLEDGE.md, gen_docs.py (TFW-40/B)
- `TOPIC_FILE.md` → `topic_file.md` — template renamed, references updated in conventions, glossary, knowledge.md workflow (TFW-40/B)
- `init.md` — Phase 2 Mini-Setup now copies from templates (not upstream files), preventing state contamination (TFW-40/A)
- `update.md` — added ⚫ STATE category, explicit merge rules for project_config.yaml (preserve project sections, update framework sections) (TFW-40/A)
- `gen_docs.py` — config path updated to `project_config.yaml` (L165-166, L530) (TFW-40/B)
- All Claude Code adapters synced: `.claude/commands/tfw-*.md` — full sync from canonical `.tfw/workflows/` (11 files). Fixes stale `PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml` references and accumulated drift from TFW-38+TFW-40 (TFW-40/B)

### Migration Notes (⚠️ BREAKING)
Projects upgrading from ≤0.8.3 must:
1. Rename `.tfw/PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml` → `.tfw/project_config.yaml`
2. Rename `.tfw/templates/TOPIC_FILE.md` → `.tfw/templates/topic_file.md` (if exists)
3. Update any custom adapter files referencing `PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml`
4. Update `docs/scripts/gen_docs.py` if customized (config path changed)

## [0.8.3] — 2026-04-15
### Added
- **4-stage review flow** — Map → Verify → Judge → Decide. Each stage = separate template file in `.tfw/templates/review/` with mindset-based identity (Student/Auditor/Judge/Decision-maker) and self-check gate. Mode selection (code/docs/spec) with `🛑 WAIT` gate (TFW-38/A, D41)
- **Review mode files** — `.tfw/workflows/review/{code,docs,spec}.md`. Mode-specific checklists (2-4 items) loaded at Step 2. Progressive Disclosure — agent loads only needed mode. 6 universal + mode-specific = hybrid (TFW-38/A, D42)
- **Knowledge Citation Table** — cascade model: Coordinator does full PV scan → HL §7.2, Executor reads HL §7.2 → ONB §7 (confirms/extends), Reviewer verifies links → verify.md (anti-hallucination gate). Unified name "Knowledge Citations" (TFW-38/B, D43)
- **Project Values (PV)** term — unified term for all accumulated project context. PV Index = 7 sources with scan priority in glossary.md. Replaces ambiguous "check values/knowledge/experience" (TFW-38/B, D44)

### Removed
- **TFW-37** (Source Audit gate) — absorbed into TFW-38 (4-stage review + Trust Protocol + docs mode source verification)
- Single-pass REVIEW workflow — replaced by 4-stage flow with file-based evidence (TFW-38/A, D41)
- 9-point monolithic review checklist — replaced by 6 universal + mode-specific (TFW-38/A, D42)

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-04
### Added
- **Researcher role** — 4th standalone role (after Coordinator, Executor, Reviewer), extracted from Coordinator following TFW-8 pattern. Own `🔒 ROLE LOCK: RESEARCHER`. Permitted: RES, `research/` stage files. Forbidden: HL, TS, ONB, RF, REVIEW, code (TFW-24)
- **Research subfolder state machine** — `research/` subfolder with stage files (`briefing.md`, `gather.md`, `extract.md`, `challenge.md`). File existence = stage completion. Crash-resilient, zero-parsing (TFW-24)
- **Resume Protocol (Step 0)** in `research/base.md` — check filesystem state → resume from first missing file. No chat history dependency (TFW-24)
- **4 research stage templates** in `.tfw/templates/research/` — briefing, gather, extract, challenge. Each with Parent HL link, Goal from §1 Vision, D28 guiding question subtitle, Checkpoint with `Stage complete: YES/NO`, Sufficiency checklist (TFW-24/B)
- **HL §1 Working Backwards** — Vision narrative ("write as if done"), Impact field, stakeholder-perspective Quote (Amazon press release pattern) (TFW-24)
- **HL §10 "Why Not Just...?"** — internal FAQ section forcing alternatives consideration before research (TFW-24)
- `tfw.content_language` config — controls artifact content language (default: `en`). Template structure always English (TFW-23)
- P14 (Filesystem = state machine) in `KNOWLEDGE.md` (TFW-24)

- **BREAKING:** HL template §1 restructured — generic "Vision" → Vision narrative + Impact + Quote (TFW-24)
- **BREAKING:** HL template §2 "Current State" — domain-agnostic ("system/process/environment" not code-specific) (TFW-23/24)
- **BREAKING:** HL template §5 "Definition of Done" — domain-agnostic checklist items (TFW-23)
- **BREAKING:** RES template — stage sections removed. RES = synthesis format (Decisions, Hypotheses, HL Recommendations, Conclusion). Stages live in `research/` subfolder (TFW-24)
- **BREAKING:** Coordinator no longer conducts research — hands off to Researcher via `/tfw-research` (TFW-24)
- `research/base.md` Steps 3/4/5 — reference `templates/research/` for stage files (TFW-24/B)
- `conventions.md` §4 — inline stage format replaced with templates reference (TFW-24/B)
- `conventions.md` §8 — Researcher role in workflows table (TFW-24)
