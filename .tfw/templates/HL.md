> **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Author**: {author}
> **Status**: 📝 HL_DRAFT — Awaiting review
> **Contract**: 📝 DRAFT — not yet approved
> **Frozen**: §1 · §3 · §4 · §5 · §6 · §7 — locked on owner approval
> **Free**: §2 · §7.2 · §8 · §9 · §10 · §11 — research updates these directly
> **Append-only**: §12 Amendment Log — the only channel for changing a frozen section
> **Baseline**: `git log -E --grep="^\[[^]]*/{PREFIX}-{N}/freeze/"`

> **Contract field** — one line, two states. Until the owner approves:
> `📝 DRAFT — not yet approved`. On approval the coordinator replaces it with
> `🔒 FROZEN — approved by {owner} YYYY-MM-DD` and commits the file before research starts.
> A frozen section may not be edited afterwards: propose in §12, wait for the verdict.

## 1. Vision 🔒 FROZEN
{Strategic narrative: what we want and why — 2-3 sentences. Write as if it's already done.}

**Impact:** {What changes when this is done — for users, team, product}

> Key quote from the stakeholder perspective — what they would say when this ships.

## 2. Current State (As-Is) 🟢 FREE
Current state: problems, structure, metrics, constraints.
Tables with REAL data where applicable.

## 3. Target State (To-Be) 🔒 FROZEN
What it should look like after. Clear deliverables.
Tables comparing As-Is → To-Be where applicable.

### 3.1 Result Visualization

> **Working Backwards:** Show the outcome as if it's already achieved. Imagine it's done —
> what does the user see? What changed? Write from the perspective of "6 months after launch."
>
> Choose the format that fits:
> - **Before → After tables** — state comparison with real data
> - **Outlines / mockups** — document structure, UI sketches, report layout
> - **Sample output** — example paragraph, data snippet, formula result
> - **Narrative** — timeline of a user's day after the change ships
>
> This is NOT a process diagram or architecture flow — those belong in §3.2 Value Flow.
> Goal: executor and user must see the "finished picture" before work begins.
> (RF uses §9 Diagrams for technical/engineering visualization.)

> **§3.1 is a gate, not an illustration.** It is the owner's checkpoint **before** the spend of
> tokens and time — the last human-legible point at which the result can still be judged cheaply.
> Four properties, all required:
>
> 1. **Written backwards from the finished state** — as if the result already exists. A description
>    of the plan that will produce it does not satisfy §3.1.
> 2. **Rendered visually — mandatory, not a format choice.** ASCII diagrams, flows, file and folder
>    trees, before/after tables, mockups, sample output. The format options above are choices of
>    *which* rendering, not permission to skip one. Prose alone does not satisfy §3.1.
> 3. **The value is shown, not only the artifact** — what the result is worth is visible in the
>    same picture as the thing that changes.
> 4. **Complete enough to hold at once** — for a multi-phase task every change carries its phase
>    label, and each phase gets one line saying what it is for. A partial picture of a five-phase
>    task is not a preview of the outcome.

### 3.2 Value Flow

> Visualize HOW value gets created — the machine, not the outcome.
> Show the flow from user pain → pipeline steps → value delivered.
>
> Formats:
> - **ASCII flow** — `INPUT → PROCESSING → OUTCOME` with value labels
> - **Mermaid diagram** — for complex multi-path flows
> - **Value stream table** — columns: Step, Input, Transformation, Value Created
>
> This is NOT the outcome preview (§3.1) — this is the process that creates the outcome.

## 4. Phases 🔒 FROZEN
Break into Phases (A, B, C...) with priorities 🔴🟡🟢.
Each Phase = separate TS→RF cycle.

### Phase Dependencies

> For multi-phase tasks: visualize dependencies and shared files.
> Omit for single-phase tasks.

{mermaid graph or ASCII flow showing phase order and dependencies}

```mermaid

  A[Phase A: {title}] --> B[Phase B: {title}]
  A --> C[Phase C: {title}]
  B --> D[Phase D: {title}]

| Phase | Depends on | Shared files | Can run in parallel with |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| A | Independent | — | — |
| B | A | {files modified by both} | C |
| C | {A or Independent} | {files modified by both} | B |
| D | B + C | {files modified by both} | — |

### Phase A: {title} 🔴

> **For multi-phase tasks (3+ phases):** include Context block per phase.
> Phase coordinator reads ONLY this block + referenced files — not all research.
>
> **Requires:** {Independent | Requires: Phase X ✅}
>
> **⚠️ Shared files with Phase X:** {files modified by multiple phases — omit if none}
>
> **Context for coordinator:** numbered list of files + specific §/D-references to read before writing Phase TS
>
> **Key decisions:** D-numbers with inline one-line summaries
>
> **⚠️ Cascade dependency:** {if modifying workflow steps — warn about adjacent steps. Omit if none}
>
> **Deliverables:** numbered list

- {bullet list of deliverables — for simple tasks without Context block}

### Phase B: {title} 🟡
- {bullet list of deliverables}

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD) 🔒 FROZEN
Numbered list. Each item starts with ✅.
Must cover all deliverables from §4 Phases.

- ✅ 1. {Criterion 1}
- ✅ 2. {Criterion 2}

## 6. Definition of Failure (DoF) 🔒 FROZEN
Numbered list. Each item starts with ❌.
What to do on failure: rollback, rethink, escalate.

- ❌ 1. {Failure condition 1}
- ❌ 2. {Failure condition 2}

**On failure:** {action plan}

## 7. Principles 🔒 FROZEN
Design philosophy. Non-negotiable rules.

1. **{Principle name}** — {description}
2. **{Principle name}** — {description}

> **Subsections inherit their parent's state** unless they carry a marker of their own.
> §3.1 and §3.2 are frozen with §3; §7.1 is frozen with §7; §7.2 is marked free explicitly.

## 7.1 Quality Contract (optional, for multi-phase tasks) 🔒 FROZEN
Anti-patterns, style rules, and constraints that MUST be copied into each Phase TS.
Purpose: prevent executor agents from drifting.
Only needed for tasks where consistency across phases matters.

### 7.2 Knowledge Citations 🟢 FREE

> Coordinator: scan PV Index (glossary.md → Project Values).
> Full scan of priorities 1-4 (README Values, philosophy.md, KNOWLEDGE.md §1, conventions.md).
> Skim priorities 5-7 for relevant items.
> Reviewer will verify these links resolve to real items.

| # | Source | Item | How it applies |
|---|--------|------|----------------|

> For new projects with empty KNOWLEDGE.md: "No applicable knowledge items — project in bootstrap phase."

## 8. Dependencies 🟢 FREE
| Dependency | Status |
|------------|--------|

### Blind Spots
- {What we do NOT know that could affect our approach}

### Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| H1 | {Statement to verify} | open |

> **Filter:** Each hypothesis: "If proven false, would our approach change?" If no — remove.

### Risks of Not Researching
{What happens IF we skip RESEARCH}

### Proposed RESEARCH Focus
1. **Gather**: {specific question}
2. **Extract**: {specific question}
3. **Challenge**: {specific question}

### Why Not Just...?
- Why not {obvious alternative A}? — {reason}
- Why not {obvious alternative B}? — {reason}

## 11. Strategic Insights (Planning) 🟢 FREE

> **Cognitive mode:** Deep analytical synthesis. Capture human-sourced domain knowledge,
> then ADD implications — what does this insight mean for the project's direction?
>
> **Human-Only Test:** Would this insight be unknown without the user saying it?
> If an agent can discover it by reading code — it's NOT a strategic insight, it's a Fact Candidate (§7).
>
> **High-value signals to watch for:**
> - User corrects direction or reframes the problem
> - User expresses emotion (frustration, excitement, urgency)
> - User shares domain knowledge not in any artifact
> - User makes strategic decisions between alternatives
> - User reveals business context, stakeholder priorities, or constraints
>
> **Categories:** conventions.md §10.1.

| # | Insight | Category | Source |
|---|---------|----------|--------|
| S1 | {insight} | {category — see §10.1} | User, {context} |

## 12. Amendment Log 🟢 APPEND-ONLY

> **Append-only.** Every proposed change to a frozen section lands here before it is applied.
> A frozen section may not be edited before its row carries a verdict. Rows are never deleted,
> never rewritten and never renumbered — a refused proposal stays visible as an attempt.
>
> **A proposal without evidence, cost and a considered alternative is not a proposal.** The three
> columns are the gate: they put the burden on the proposer, which is what keeps declining cheap.
>
> **A remark inside a research thread is input, never a verdict.** Only an explicit owner ruling,
> recorded on the row, changes a proposal's status. An **owner-initiated** change to a frozen
> section is an amendment too: same row, `Proposer` = owner, verdict on the same line.
>
> **`Type` states the change's relation to the baseline** — never its disposition:
> - `EXTEND` — adds to a frozen claim, the original stays in force
> - `SUPERSEDE` — replaces a frozen claim
> - `RESTRICT` — narrows: adds a DoF item, tightens scope, drops a deliverable. A restrictive
>   change applies **on filing** and is logged with the verdict `✅ APPLIED — no owner verdict
>   required`. Restrictive-free is prohibited — the classifier benefits from the label.
>
> **`Verdict` values:** `PROPOSED` (awaiting a ruling) · `✅ APPROVED — {ruler}, YYYY-MM-DD` ·
> `❌ REJECTED — {ruler}, YYYY-MM-DD` · `✅ APPLIED — no owner verdict required` (`RESTRICT` only) ·
> `🚫 WITHDRAWN — {proposer}, YYYY-MM-DD` (retracted by its own proposer, only before a ruling —
> the row stays, because deleting it would break append-only and marking it `❌ REJECTED` would
> credit the owner with a decision they never made).
> `PROPOSED` describes the state of the *request*, which is what this log tracks — not the state of
> the world, which is what the frozen sections already record.
>
> An approved amendment is applied and then **re-frozen**: a new freeze commit at the new baseline.
> Full rules: conventions.md §3 → HL Contract.
>
> If nothing was ever proposed, write: **No amendments.**

| # | Date | § | Type | Proposer | Proposed change | Evidence | Cost | Alternatives considered | Verdict |
|---|------|---|------|----------|-----------------|----------|------|------------------------|---------|
| A1 | YYYY-MM-DD | §{n} | `EXTEND` / `SUPERSEDE` / `RESTRICT` | {owner / coordinator / research iterN / executor} | {what changes} | {where the finding comes from} | {what it costs to accept} | {what else was weighed and why it lost} | `PROPOSED` |

> **Cross-references**: use Reference Format (e.g. `RF TFW-18`, `D24`, `TD-72`). See compilable_contract.md §2. Build script resolves to hyperlinks.
