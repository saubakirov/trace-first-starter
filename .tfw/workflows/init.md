# TFW Init — Project Initialization

> **Role:** Coordinator
> **Output:** Configured TFW project with its first task created in the container
> **When to use:** Once, when adding TFW to a project for the first time

> **🔒 ROLE LOCK: COORDINATOR**
> Permitted: creating project files (CONFIG, AGENTS.md, README route, task container, adapter),
> calling /tfw-research, writing RES/RF for the first task.
> Forbidden: writing code unrelated to TFW setup.

## Phase 0: Detect Full Init vs Adapter Attach/Repair

Before the tutorial question or project discovery, inspect the filesystem.

- **Full init:** `.tfw/` is newly copied and the project has no configured task container
  or TFW task traces. Continue with Phases 1-5.
- **Existing TFW project:** `.tfw/` exists, `tfw.task_containers` is configured, and the container
  contains TFW traces. Preserve all project state. Do not repeat discovery, interview,
  research, config creation, or the init task.

For an existing TFW project, ask which missing or broken tool adapter should be
attached only if the current tool cannot be inferred. For Codex:

1. Read `.tfw/adapters/codex/README.md` completely.
2. Run its idempotent **Install or Repair** procedure.
3. Preserve `project_config.yaml`, `knowledge_state.yaml`, project docs, task state and journals,
   task traces, and all root `AGENTS.md` content outside the managed TFW markers.
4. Verify the installed skill copies, managed routing block, legacy duplicate cleanup,
   and literal `/tfw-*` routing as the adapter README requires.
5. Report what was repaired and stop. Adapter attach/repair does not create another
   first task or rewrite project knowledge.

## Tutorial Mode

At the start, ask the user:
"Is this your first time using TFW? I can explain each step as we go."
If yes — add brief explanations at each phase.
If no — proceed efficiently, skip explanations.

If tutorial mode, suggest:
"We recommend reading `.tfw/README.md` — it explains the philosophy behind TFW
and takes about 5 minutes. Everything else in the repo is designed for AI agents,
not for you to read line by line."

### Mini-examples for first-time users

Use these when tutorial mode is on:

**Task prefix** — a short code for your project's task IDs:
- `RND` → tasks are RND-1, RND-2, RND-3...
- `APP` → tasks are APP-1, APP-2, APP-3...

**Where tasks live** — one directory per task, inside the configured container, nested by
creation year. Each carries its own `status.md`, which is the only authority for its state:

```
{container}/2026/20260826-143000__tfw_init/
  status.md        lifecycle, owner, goal, value, link to authority
  journal/         one immutable file per coordination event
```

Nothing at the project root is edited to move a task forward. The root README carries a
permanent route to `{container}/00-INDEX.md`, a derived view rebuilt from task state by
`python .tfw/scripts/gen_index.py` — useful for browsing, never authoritative.

| RND-3 | Client onboarding workflow | ⬜ TODO |

## Who Is Acting

Resolve the acting handle **before the first durable write** — before any `status.md` change,
any journal event, any commit. Once per session, not per turn.

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| One profile in `team/` | it is used, silently |
| Several profiles | read the binding on **this machine** — `~/.tfw/bindings.yaml`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tfw\bindings.yaml` |
| No binding · a shared device · a copied binding · a handle whose profile is gone | **ask exactly one short question**, then proceed |

Identity is never inferred from an OS username, hostname, folder name or account display
string. Every event this session writes carries `on_behalf_of` (always a human) and `via`
(the tool). A writer is not named yet — that is TFW-54 — so do not create a profile per
session. → `conventions.md` §4

## Phase 1: Discover

Read the project to understand what exists:
- **Purpose and goals:** What is this project about? What problem does it solve?
- **Existing documentation:** README, notes, specs, decision records
- **Structure:** How is the project organized? Folders, files, naming patterns
- **Processes:** How does work happen today? Tools, workflows, conventions
- **People:** Who is involved? Roles, stakeholders, domain experts
- **For software projects specifically:** stack, build/CI config, dependencies, tests

Present findings to the user:
"I found: {purpose}, {structure}, {processes}. Is this accurate?
Anything I'm missing?"

## Phase 2: Interview + Mini-Setup

### Interview
Ask the user (max 3 questions per batch):

Batch 1 — Identity:
- "What task prefix do you want? (e.g., PROJ, APP, your abbreviation)"
- "How do you verify that work is done correctly?" _(for software: build/test/lint commands; for other domains: review process, checklists, approval flow)_
- "Which AI tool are you using? (Claude Code / Cursor / Antigravity / Codex / multiple)"
- "What language should I use for artifact content? (default: English)"

Batch 2 — Context (if needed):
- "Any specific conventions I should know about? (naming, branching, etc.)"
- "Is this a greenfield or brownfield project?"

### Mini-Setup
After interview, create the skeleton:
1. Copy `.tfw/templates/project_config.yaml` → `.tfw/project_config.yaml`
   Fill with discovered + interview data (`project.*`, `tfw.task_containers`, `content_language`, `build.*`). **No `initial_seq`** — identifiers come from the clock, so there is no counter to seed
2. Copy `.tfw/templates/knowledge_state.yaml` → `.tfw/knowledge_state.yaml`
   (no modifications needed — clean state)
3. **Create `team/` together with its first profile** — copy `.tfw/templates/team/profile.md`
   to `team/{handle}.md` and fill the four keys. This is step 3 and not the last step: every
   write below carries an `on_behalf_of`, and it names a handle this file declares. One profile
   per **person** — `team/` holds people, and a writer is not named until TFW-54, so do not
   create one per agent session. `team/` is never created empty: a directory with no profile
   explains nothing and satisfies nothing
4. Create the container directory named by `tfw.task_containers[0]`
5. Add the route section to README.md (or append if README exists), pointing at
   `{container}/00-INDEX.md`
6. Create the first task folder — `{container}/{YYYY}/{ID}/`, where `{ID}` is the whole
   identifier `{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}__tfw_init` taken from the clock. **The slug is part of the
   identifier**, so nothing is appended after it. Read no counter and no other task directory.
   Worked example: `workspace/2026/20260827-054300__tfw_init/`
7. Write its `status.md` from `.tfw/templates/status.md` with `lifecycle: RES`, and a
   `created` event into its `journal/` as `{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}__{kind}__{token}.md`, with the time read from the clock
8. Confirm the result: `python .tfw/scripts/gen_index.py --check project`. It reports on the
   payload, `team/`, the container configuration, retired keys and carrier validity, and it
   writes nothing

[Tutorial: "Each task gets its own folder, and its state lives inside it. That is what lets
two people work on different tasks at once without editing the same file. This first task is
the initialization itself — you'll see its status.md change as we work."]

## Phase 3: Knowledge

Announce to the user:
"Now I'll run a RESEARCH session to study your project in depth.
This is the /tfw-research workflow — it helps uncover important details
before we finalize the setup."

Run `/tfw-research` formally within the first task:
- Mode: Standalone (the task already exists)
- RES file: `{task}/RES__{ID}.md` — e.g. `RES__20260827-054300__tfw_init.md`. The identifier
  already carries the slug; appending the title again would double it
- Focus: architecture, key decisions, dependencies, domain terms,
  tech debt, conventions not covered in interview

After RESEARCH completes, use findings to inform Phase 4.

[Tutorial: "RESEARCH is a stage where I study the project and ask
pointed questions. It produces a RES file — a record of what we found.
You'll use /tfw-research for your own tasks too."]

## Phase 4: Full Setup

Create/update all TFW files using knowledge from Phases 1-3:

1. **AGENTS.md** — role description adapted to project context
2. **KNOWLEDGE.md** — from `.tfw/templates/KNOWLEDGE.md`, filled with
   Phase 3 findings (architecture, decisions, tech stack)
3. **TECH_DEBT.md** — empty or with initial entries if found
4. **Adapter files** — based on user's tool choice:
   - Claude Code: copy `CLAUDE.md.template` → `CLAUDE.md`, fill in project values.
     Copy each `.tfw/workflows/*.md` → `.claude/commands/tfw-{name}.md` (e.g. `plan.md` → `tfw-plan.md`, etc.)
   - Cursor: copy `tfw.mdc.template` → `.cursor/rules/tfw.mdc`
   - Antigravity: copy `.tfw/adapters/antigravity/rules/` → `.agent/rules/`.
     Copy each `.tfw/workflows/*.md` → `.agent/workflows/tfw-{name}.md` (e.g. `plan.md` → `tfw-plan.md`, etc.)
   - Codex: read `.tfw/adapters/codex/README.md` and execute its complete Install or
     Repair contract. Install exact `.agents/skills/tfw-*` copies, merge the
     marker-bounded TFW routing block into root `AGENTS.md`, preserve unrelated
     instructions and skills, remove only confirmed legacy `source-command-tfw-*`
     workflow copies, and verify literal `/tfw-*` routing.
   Claude Code and Antigravity receive workflow copies; Codex receives exact skill
   copies. Codex normally detects skill changes automatically; starting a new task or
   restarting Codex is only a fallback when discovery does not refresh.
5. **`.user_preferences.md`** — suggest creating a personal preferences file:
   - Template content:
     ```markdown
     # User Preferences

     > ⚠️ PERSONAL FILE — DO NOT COMMIT TO GIT
     > This file stores individual user preferences for AI agents.
     > It is listed in .gitignore by default.
     > To disable: set `tfw.user_preferences: false` in `.tfw/project_config.yaml`

     ## Communication
     - Language: {your language}
     - Tone: {direct / friendly / formal}

     ## Work Style
     - {preferences}
     ```
   - Add `.user_preferences.md` to `.gitignore`
6. **Update project_config.yaml** — finalize all values
7. **Set the first task's state** — `lifecycle: RF` in its `status.md`

[Tutorial: "I'm creating the project files now. AGENTS.md tells AI agents
how to behave in your project. KNOWLEDGE.md captures what I learned about
your architecture. The adapter connects your AI tool to TFW."]

## Phase 5: Verify

Run through checklist (present to user):

- [ ] `.tfw/` directory exists with all core files
- [ ] `.tfw/project_config.yaml` has correct project values
- [ ] Tool adapter is in place and configured
- [ ] **Slash commands copied** — verify adapter workflows exist:
  - Antigravity: `.agent/workflows/tfw-plan.md`, `tfw-handoff.md`, `tfw-review.md` (+ others)
  - Claude Code: `.claude/commands/tfw-plan.md`, `tfw-handoff.md`, `tfw-review.md` (+ others)
- [ ] **Codex commands installed** (when selected) — all 11 `.agents/skills/tfw-*`
  copies match `.tfw/adapters/codex/skills/`, root `AGENTS.md` has exactly one managed
  TFW routing block, confirmed `source-command-tfw-*` duplicates are gone, and a
  literal `/tfw-*` smoke test reaches the matching local workflow
- [ ] Root files exist: README.md (with the route to the portfolio index), AGENTS.md
- [ ] the configured container exists, holds the first task, and that task has a `status.md`
- [ ] KNOWLEDGE.md created (or consciously skipped for greenfield)
- [ ] the first task has a RES file from RESEARCH
- [ ] `tfw.version` in project_config.yaml matches `.tfw/VERSION`

Write RF for the first task:
- List all created/modified files
- Key decisions from interview
- RESEARCH findings summary
- Verification results

Close the first task: `lifecycle: DONE` and a filled `outcome` in its `status.md`, plus a
closing `transition` event in its `journal/`. Rebuild the view when it suits you —
`python .tfw/scripts/gen_index.py` — it is a deliberate act, never a side effect of the
transition.

[Tutorial: "That's it! TFW is set up. Your next step: run /tfw-plan
to create your first real task. The cycle is: plan → research (optional)
→ spec → execute → review. Each step produces trace files so any AI agent
can pick up where you left off."]

## Anti-patterns

- Agent skips Interview and fills CONFIG with guesses
- Agent skips Knowledge phase without asking user
- Agent creates adapter for wrong tool
- Agent creates the first task without a `status.md`, leaving it invisible to every consumer
- Agent doesn't explain what it's doing (when tutorial mode is on)
- Agent runs full init on a project that already has .tfw/ configured
  (must run adapter attach/repair instead)
- Agent overwrites root `AGENTS.md` instead of merging only the managed TFW block
- Agent reports Codex ready from file existence without testing literal `/tfw-*` routing
- Agent copies `knowledge_state.yaml` directly from upstream instead of from template
  (inherits upstream's consolidation history — breaks knowledge gate)
