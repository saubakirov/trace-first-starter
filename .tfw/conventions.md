# TFW Conventions

## 1) Purpose

TFW turns work (analytics, documents, code, research) into a reproducible process:
- context is captured,
- decisions are traced,
- results are repeatable,
- any agent can continue the project in a new session.

## 2) Required Artifacts (project root)

- `README.md` — human explanation: why/what/how, and a permanent route to the derived portfolio index. It carries no live task table and is not edited by a lifecycle transition.
- `AGENTS.md` — AI agent behavior rules for the project.
- `KNOWLEDGE.md` _(optional)_ — project knowledge index: architecture, decisions, legacy. Template: `.tfw/templates/KNOWLEDGE.md`.
- `RELEASE.md` _(optional)_ — project release strategy and context. Template: `.tfw/templates/RELEASE.md`.
- `.tfw/README.md` — TFW philosophy, lifecycle, values.
- `.tfw/conventions.md` — project conventions (this file).
- `.tfw/glossary.md` — project glossary.
- `.tfw/templates/HL.md` — canonical HL template.
- `.tfw/templates/TS.md` — canonical TS template.
- `.tfw/templates/RF.md` — canonical RF template.
- `.tfw/templates/ONB.md` — canonical Onboarding Report template.

- `.tfw/workflows/update.md` — canonical upstream update workflow.
- `.tfw/workflows/config.md` — interactive config change workflow.
- `.tfw/VERSION` — current framework version (semver, single line).
- `.tfw/CHANGELOG.md` — version history (Keep a Changelog format).
- `.tfw/project_config.yaml` — project configuration (stack, build commands, task prefix, execution engine).
- `.tfw/compilable_contract.md` — build-time compilation specification (Source Manifest, Reference Format, Output Structure).
- `.tfw/scripts/gen_index.py` — derived portfolio index, and the three `--check` subjects. Shipped inside the payload; finds the project root by marker, so a project may place it anywhere.
- `.tfw/scripts/migrate_board.py` — one-time board retirement with exact accounting.
- `.tfw/migrations/{major}.md` — migration guide per major version. A major release without one is incomplete.

### HL (High Level)
Context/frame. Not a task — a "map of meaning".
Format: strictly follows `.tfw/templates/HL.md`.

#### HL Contract

An approved HL is a contract, not a draft. Approval is the moment it freezes.

| HL section | State after owner approval |
|------------|---------------------------|
| §1 Vision · §3 Target State (incl. §3.1, §3.2) · §4 Phases · §5 DoD · §6 DoF · §7 Principles (incl. §7.1) | 🔒 FROZEN |
| §2 Current State · §7.2 Knowledge Citations · §8 Dependencies · §9 Risks · §10 RESEARCH Case · §11 Strategic Insights | 🟢 FREE |
| §12 Amendment Log | 🟢 APPEND-ONLY |

1. **The contract state is artifact state.** The HL header carries a `Contract` field with two values: `📝 DRAFT — not yet approved` and `🔒 FROZEN — approved by {owner} YYYY-MM-DD`. Task status tracks the pipeline; the `Contract` field tracks the artifact. They are not interchangeable.
2. **Free sections stay free.** Research and the coordinator update §2, §7.2, §8, §9, §10 and §11 directly, with no proposal and no verdict. Risk registers, hypothesis statuses and dependency statuses are required to move.
3. **A frozen section may not be edited.** The only channel is §12 Amendment Log: propose, wait for the owner's verdict, then apply. This holds for every role, including the coordinator that authored the HL.
4. **§12 is append-only.** Rows are never deleted, rewritten or renumbered. A refused proposal stays visible as an attempt — that visibility is the point.
5. **The frozen unit is the declarative claim, not the section text.** Frozen at claim level: the phase set and each phase's declared outcome, §3's to-be claims, each §5 and §6 item, each §7 principle, and §1. Rewording a claim without changing it is not an amendment; changing what it commits to is.
6. **Deliverable lists inside an already-approved phase are free** — specifying *how* a phase meets its declared outcome is refinement. **Tripwire:** if the change cannot be accepted under §5 and §6 *as they stand at the moment of classification*, it is an amendment. Two tables decide it; no judgement call is required.
7. **Non-substantive edits are not amendments** — typos, broken links, formatting, renumbering of free-section rows.
8. **A verdict is a distinct recorded act.** Input given inside a research thread, a review or a chat is evidence for a proposal, never approval of one. A proposal is ruled only by an explicit owner verdict written onto its §12 row.
9. **An owner-initiated change to a frozen section is an amendment too** — logged in §12 with the owner as `Proposer` and the verdict on the same row. The log's value is the record, not the gate: a §12 that omits the owner's own changes cannot answer the question it exists to answer.
10. **A restrictive change applies on filing.** Narrowing — adding a DoF item, tightening scope, dropping a deliverable — is logged with `Type` = `RESTRICT` and verdict `✅ APPLIED — no owner verdict required`. Restrictive-free is prohibited: the classifier benefits from the label, so the log costs nothing and removes the incentive.
11. **`Type` states relation to the baseline, never disposition.** `EXTEND` adds and the original stays in force; `SUPERSEDE` replaces; `RESTRICT` narrows. Disposition belongs in `Verdict`.
12. **A proposal without evidence, cost and a considered alternative is not a proposal.** The burden sits on the proposer, which is what keeps declining cheap.

**Contract Baseline** — a frozen contract that cannot be diffed is not frozen.

13. **The approved HL is committed before the first research iteration.** An uncommitted baseline makes "frozen" permanently unverifiable (TFW-48 precedent).
14. **The baseline reference is a reserved `freeze` scope word** in the commit subject, per the `[agent/task/scope/role]` grammar in §4: `[claude-code/PROJ-7/freeze/coordinator] freeze approved hl`. It applies to the **first** freeze and to every re-freeze after an approved amendment.
15. **Recovery form:** `git log --format="%h %s"`, filtered on `^\S+ \[[^]]*/{TASK-ID}/freeze/`. Both properties were learned from live failures and survive any edit: filter the **subject**, never the message — `--grep` also returns commits that merely quote a freeze subject; and never start the pattern with `/` — some shells rewrite a leading slash as a path.
16. **No header field can name its own commit** — a commit's SHA cannot appear in its own content. The baseline lives in the commit subject, not in the file, and needs no separate registry.

**Delegated authority**

17. **A delegated mandate is a ceiling, never a source of new permission.** It bounds what an agent may do; it does not create what an agent may do.
18. **No agent may widen its own grant.** Authority that can justify its own extension is not authority, it is a loop.
19. **Delegation is never valid authority to accept a scope or budget overrun.** "I was delegated this decision" does not convert an overrun into a compliant result.

**Phase HL**

20. **A Phase HL is derivation-only.** It may restate master content and add execution context — files, sequencing, phase-local risks.
21. **A Phase HL may not carry its own §1, §5, §6 or §7.** Vision, acceptance criteria, failure conditions and principles exist once, in the master HL. A Phase HL that authors them is a second, unapproved contract.

### Project North Star

The layer above every task HL: what the product is for, and what it must never become. Together with the
contract baseline it is the reference set of the Purpose Check (`templates/review/judge.md` row 2a),
and it is PV priority 0 (`glossary.md`).

1. **Locus: designated section(s) of a README.** More than one location is permitted — a project whose
   product is its own method may designate sections of both its root README and its philosophy paper.
2. **A task HL may never be nominated.** Nominating one promotes a task contract to project authority with
   no gate at the promotion point, and imports contract drift one level up. Supporting that locus properly
   would need a project-level freeze mechanism, which TFW does not define.
3. **Payload: purpose, principles and non-goals.** Non-goals are not optional. The failure mode this layer
   exists to catch is *excess*, not opposition, and a purpose statement alone cannot detect excess.
4. **Admission criteria.** A clause belongs here if it states what the product *is for* or *must never
   become*. If a single task's implementation choice could satisfy or violate it, it is a principle
   (HL §7), not a north-star clause. This is a criterion, not a size cap — a list carrying implementation
   detail satisfies a citation requirement forever while blocking nothing.
5. **Optional, with a declared fallback:** project north star → master HL §1 at the contract baseline. A
   review is never blocked on a missing north star.
6. **PV priority 0 and priority 1 may name the same file.** They are distinguished by what the section says
   — *what we are building* versus *how we build* — never by which file holds it. Where the product is the
   methodology, one file legitimately carries both.
7. **Citation namespace:** `NS{n}` for north-star clauses; HL §7 keeps `P{n}`; a project principle registry
   uses `PP{n}` (see `compilable_contract.md` §2).

### RES (Research Report)
Structured investigation artifact. Produced via Briefing → Gather → Extract → Challenge stages in `research/` subfolder.
RES file = synthesis (Decisions, Hypotheses, HL Recommendations, Conclusion). Stage files = raw investigation.
Created between HL and TS (pipeline) or standalone for any research.
Format: strictly follows `.tfw/templates/RES.md`.

### TS (Task Spec)
Task definition. Always self-contained: inputs/outputs/constraints/DoD.
Format: strictly follows `.tfw/templates/TS.md`.

### RF (Result File)
Results/facts/data/final text. RF has priority as source of truth.
Contains mandatory Observations table (structured, typed).
Format: strictly follows `.tfw/templates/RF.md`.

### ONB (Onboarding Report)
Structured executor report before starting: understanding, questions, risks, inconsistencies.
Coordinator/human answers directly in the file (Q&A format).
Format: strictly follows `.tfw/templates/ONB.md`.

### REVIEW (Review Report)
Formal coordinator report after reviewing RF: checklist, verdict, and a disposition on every debt item it captured.
Format: strictly follows `.tfw/templates/REVIEW.md`.

### Fact Candidates (section in RF, REVIEW, RES)
Raw observations about the project recorded during work. Cognitive mode: pure reporting — record factual without interpretation. NOT verified facts — they become facts after `/tfw-knowledge` consolidation. Each artifact has a Fact Candidates section with a structured table (Category, Candidate, Source, Confidence). Quality filter: "Would the next agent decide differently knowing this?"

### Visual Sections (per-template)

> **Decision criterion:** "Does the cognitive mode CHANGE between templates?" If yes → per-template naming. If no → unified.
> Visual sections trigger different cognitive modes per template context (empirically validated: RES3 D22, RES4 Exp1+Exp2).

| Template | Section | Cognitive Mode | What it produces |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| HL | §3.1 Result Visualization | Narrative / Outcome | Outcome preview — Working Backwards style ("imagine it's done") |
| HL | §3.2 Value Flow | Strategic / Value-oriented | Value streams, INPUT→PROCESSING→OUTCOME, transformation tables |
| RF | §9 Diagrams | Technical / Engineering | Architecture, ERD, sequence diagrams, component diagrams |
| RES | Findings Map | Analytical / Research | Root cause analysis, hypothesis trees, priority matrices |
| REVIEW | — | — | No visual section (checklist artifact, not result) |

### Knowledge Capture Sections (unified naming)

| Section | Name | Templates | Cognitive Mode |
|---------|------|-----------|---------------|
| §7 | Fact Candidates | RF, RES, REVIEW | Pure reporting: record without interpretation |
| §8/§11 | Strategic Insights + qualifier | HL (Planning), RF (Execution), RES (Research) | Deep analytical synthesis: capture + add implications |

### Knowledge Input Sections (unified naming)

| Section | Name | Templates | Cognitive Mode |
|---------|------|-----------|----------------|
| §7.2 | Knowledge Citations | HL | Input tracing: cite the exact PV clause/item read, link it, and state its concrete application |
| §7 | Knowledge Citations | ONB | Input tracing: confirm the exact HL §7.2 items read and how each applies; add new relevant items |
| _(section)_ | Knowledge Citations Verified | review/verify.md | Verification: check link resolution, item existence, semantic match, and relevance to the asserted application |

> **Unified naming rationale (D43/D28/D39):** cognitive mode is the same across all three — "report what you read and how it applies." Same mode = same name. Scan scope differs by role: Coordinator + Reviewer do full PV scan, Executor references coordinator's citations. See glossary.md → Project Values (PV).
>
> **Semantic integrity:** a citation that resolves to a real file or anchor but names an absent, irrelevant,
> or semantically different item is a discrepancy, not a verified citation. Priorities 0 and 1 must be
> recorded and checked as distinct meaning even when one README contains both.

### Evidence Sections (per-template)

> Evidence = real-world verification of completed work in its intended environment.
> Separate from Verification (RF §4 — synthetic tool output: lint, test, build).
> Status vocabulary: VERIFIED / DEFERRED / BLOCKED / N/A.
> Role pipeline: Coordinator designs (TS) → Executor collects (EV file) → Reviewer audits (REVIEW).
>
> **Mandatory folder:** Every task directory MUST contain an `evidence/` subfolder with a structured EV file.
> The EV file captures environment metadata, per-AC verification results, and a verdict summary.
> RF §5 is a pointer to the EV file — not a duplicate of the evidence table.
> Template: `.tfw/templates/evidence/EV.md`.

| Template | Section | Cognitive Mode | What it produces |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| TS | Evidence field (in §5 AC items) | Prescriptive / Planning | What to verify in real environment, suggested tools |
| EV file | `evidence/EV__{...}.md` | Observational / Verification | Environment header, per-AC evidence table, verdict, attachments |
| RF | §5 Evidence (pointer) | Summary / Reference | One-line pointer to EV file + verdict summary |
| review/verify.md | Evidence Verification | Audit / Trust-but-verify | Artifact existence checks, claim-vs-reality |
| review/judge.md | Check #7 Evidence completeness | Judicial / Completeness | All TS Evidence fields covered in EV file? |

## 4) Task Identity and Location

### Where tasks live

`tfw.task_containers` in `.tfw/project_config.yaml` is an **ordered list** of container paths.
A task is **created** in the first entry; a task is **resolved** by searching every entry in
order. That is one setting, not two supported layouts.

```
{container}/{YYYY}/{id}__{slug}/
```

The year is the year the task was **created**, and it never changes. A task opened in December
and closed the following March stays in the earlier folder. Recomputing it would move a
directory, and moving a directory breaks every reference into it.

**No lifecycle state is expressed by moving a directory.** Not `TODO`, not `DONE`, not
`REJECTED`. A path is created once and outlives every state the task passes through. Status
lives in the task's own `status.md`; a folder move would ask a sync engine to relocate a
directory other participants may be writing inside, and would invalidate references that
already resolve.

A project migrating from a pre-2.0.0 layout lists its old container second. Its existing
tasks are not renamed, not moved and not reorganized: all three named identifier grammars stay
readable everywhere, and the old paths keep resolving.

### Identifier

```
PREFIX_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_ABBR  the whole directory name IS the identifier
```

`PREFIX` is `tfw.task_prefix`; `ABBR` is the **acronym of the approved full title** — the
initials of its significant words, uppercase alphanumeric: *Conflict Resistant Shared Workspace*
→ `CRSW`; *Assisted 1.5 core and synchronization* → `ASSISTED15`, digits being alphanumeric.
Neither field may contain `_`, so the single underscores are unambiguous separators. The timestamp is read from the system clock after the abbreviation is
approved; it is never composed or adjusted. Every reference, commit subject and index row
carries the full identifier.

**No participant reads a project-wide maximum to learn which identifier is free.** There is no
counter, registry or allocation step. Creation performs only one exact-path existence check.

The coordinator proposes the full title and its initials **together, in one exchange**, and
the owner approves both before a directory is created; the HL header carries them side by side
as **Title** and **Abbreviation**. *Never derived silently* means two things: never invented
apart from the title — `UPD` for a task with no title behind it is the anti-pattern, an opaque
code a person cannot read back — and never created without the owner's approval. A title is
what makes the approval a decision rather than a formality.

If the full identifier already exists at creation, creation refuses and asks for a different
owner-approved abbreviation. It never recomputes the timestamp, adds a suffix or silently
retries: any of those would invent a different identifier from the one the exchange approved.
When offline work later exposes two directories that normalize to one identifier, validation
stops and names both paths.

**A bare timestamp is not an identifier.** Two participants can reach the same second, so a bare
`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` cannot name exactly one task and no consumer accepts one as if it did.

Two historical grammars remain readable forever and are never renamed or issued again:

- legacy `PREFIX-N`, optionally carried by a directory as `PREFIX-N__slug`, normalizes to
  `PREFIX-N`;
- `2.0.0-dirty` `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS__slug` keeps its whole directory name as the identifier.

### Task control files

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `{task}/status.md` | **The only authority for that task's live state.** Closed key set, bounded fields, no free-text body. Template: `.tfw/templates/status.md` |
| `{task}/journal/{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}__{kind}__{token}.md` | One event, immutable once written. The filename **is** the event identifier — nothing allocates it. Template: `.tfw/templates/journal/event.md` |
| `{task}/{phase}/journal/…` | A phase carries its own journal, exactly as it carries its own `status.md`. Same grammar, same rules |
| `team/{handle}.md` | One participant. Declared attribution, never authentication. Template: `.tfw/templates/team/profile.md` |

**The third component of the filename has exactly one job: two writes in one second cannot
share a name.** It is a short opaque token. It is **not an identity** — it names nobody,
requires no profile, and is validated against nothing, because uniqueness is the whole of
what it does. If it ever acquires a second job, it is the wrong mechanism.

That is not a detail of implementation, it is the correction of a design error, and the error
is worth stating because it is the kind that survives review. The component used to be the
`actor` handle, and it was given two unrelated jobs at once: *say who wrote this* and *make
the name unique*. The two contradict each other. A distinct writer needs a distinct value; a
declared handle needs a profile in `team/`. Two external projects resolved that the only way
that lets work proceed — a profile per agent session — and one of them later deleted those
profiles and left its validation gate **red permanently**, because events are immutable and
profiles are not. The operators did not err. They followed the design, and the design
contradicted itself.

A collision is re-drawn, not waited out. There is no counter — a counter is the shared state
this model exists to remove — and no second is ever invented: the clock is read once and the
reading is used as it was read.

The timestamp is **read from the system clock at the moment of writing** and is never
composed, guessed, rounded or typed. A typed timestamp destroys the ordering the journal
exists to provide.

A written event is never edited and never deleted; a correction is a new event that
references the one it corrects. A rule introduced later may describe older entries but never
rewrite them.

**Some artifacts legitimately have no journal event, and that is how the vocabulary stays
closed.** The `kind` list is closed; an artifact whose nature no `kind` covers is filed
without an event, and no event is invented for it. The worked example is an inbound advisory
record — a field report from another project: it is coordination-relevant, it escalates
nothing, it requests no verdict, and forcing it into `amendment_escalated` would misreport it
as awaiting an owner ruling.

The journal answers *how did this task's state get here*. An artifact that changed no state
has nothing to contribute to that answer, and its own file is where it lives. A closed
vocabulary that opens at the first inconvenience was never closed.

Every event carries two identity fields, answering two different questions:

| Field | Answers | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `on_behalf_of` | who is accountable | **always a human handle** declared in `team/`. Whoever launched it answers for it |
| `via` | what produced it | when present, non-empty free-form provider/tool text such as `claude-code` or `codex`; absent for a hand edit |

**An event without `on_behalf_of` is invalid and is refused.** There is no such thing as a
record nobody answers for.

`via` is descriptive provenance, not a registry value or authentication claim. Consumers
require a non-empty string when the field is present and preserve it; they do not constrain
it to a provider enum.

### Which handle a machine acts as

One profile in `team/` — it is used, and nothing is asked.

Several profiles — the acting handle comes from a **binding held on the participant's own
machine**, never in this tree: `~/.tfw/bindings.yaml` on POSIX,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\tfw\bindings.yaml` on Windows. Template:
`.tfw/templates/bindings.yaml`.

```yaml
bindings:
  /abs/path/to/project: handle
```

One mapping per project and nothing else in the file. Its single job is to say which handle
this machine acts as; it grants nothing and proves nothing.

It lives outside the project because a project-local file can be gitignored but **not
sync-ignored** — under file synchronization a per-user file reaches every participant sharing
the folder. Per-machine by construction, not by a rule someone remembers.

No binding, a shared device, a copied binding, or a handle whose profile is gone: **ask
exactly one short question** before the first durable write, once per session, then proceed.

Identity is never inferred from an OS username, hostname, folder name or account display
string. A machine does not know who is sitting at it, and a guess becomes a durable
attribution nobody made.

> Seven workflows instruct a session to read this file. Until `2.0.0-dirty.3` nothing in the
> payload said what it contains, so an agent told to read it had nothing to parse and an agent
> that wanted to create one had nothing to write. A mechanism instructed seven times and
> defined zero times is not a mechanism.

**A writer is not named yet, and saying so is the point.** There used to be a third field,
`actor`, meant to name who performed the act. Naming a writer needs a principal that delegates
and answers to someone — and TFW does not have one until **TFW-54**. Until then a provider
family is not a writer (two sessions of one tool are two writers), a session is not a person,
and inventing a per-session profile to satisfy a validator is what two external projects were
forced into. So the field is not there. `team/` holds people.

**An `actor` already written is tolerated, never required, and never rewritten.** Every event
in every existing corpus carries it, and an event is never edited. A reader treats it as a
pre-`2.0.0-dirty.3` record: no error, no comparison against `team/`, no dangling handle. That
tolerance is not leniency — it is the only reading under which the correction costs no project
any data and no operator any work.

### Artifact file naming

| Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Master HL, current grammar | `HL-{ID}.md` | `HL-TFW_20260829-172110_ABT.md` |
| Single-phase RES, current grammar | `RES__{ID}.md` | `RES__TFW_20260829-172110_ABT.md` |
| Master HL | `HL-{ID}.md` | `HL-20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Single-phase RES | `RES__{ID}.md` | `RES__20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Single-phase TS | `TS__{ID}.md` | `TS__20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Single-phase RF | `RF__{ID}.md` | `RF__20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Single-phase ONB | `ONB__{ID}.md` | `ONB__20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Single-phase REVIEW | `REVIEW__{ID}.md` | `REVIEW__20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Single-phase EV | `EV__{ID}.md` | `EV__20260826-143000__query_redesign.md` |
| Phase RES | `RES__phase-{x}__{title}.md` | `RES__phase-a__conventions.md` |
| Phase TS | `TS__phase-{x}__{title}.md` | `TS__phase-a__conventions.md` |
| Phase RF | `RF__phase-{x}__{title}.md` | `RF__phase-a__conventions.md` |
| Phase ONB | `ONB__phase-{x}__{title}.md` | `ONB__phase-a__conventions.md` |
| Phase REVIEW | `REVIEW__phase-{x}__{title}.md` | `REVIEW__phase-a__conventions.md` |
| Phase EV | `EV__phase-{x}__{title}.md` | `EV__phase-a__conventions.md` |
| Single-phase TS revision | `TS__{ID}__rev{N}.md` | `TS__TFW_20260829-172110_ABT__rev2.md` |
| Single-phase REVIEW revision | `REVIEW__{ID}__rev{N}.md` | `REVIEW__TFW_20260829-172110_ABT__rev2.md` |
| Phase TS revision | `TS__phase-{x}__{title}__rev{N}.md` | `TS__phase-a__conventions__rev2.md` |
| Phase REVIEW revision | `REVIEW__phase-{x}__{title}__rev{N}.md` | `REVIEW__phase-a__conventions__rev2.md` |

**`{ID}` is the task's whole identifier**, and it means the same thing everywhere: in a path,
in a filename, in a reference and in `status.md`. For a current-grammar task that is
`TFW_20260829-172110_ABT` and for a clock task `20260826-143000__query_redesign` — **no title is
appended** to either. The identifier is the whole name; a filename is `HL-{ID}.md` exactly, and
`HL-TFW_20260829-172110_ABT__approved_fixture.md` is a name this contract rejects, just as a
clock task's doubled slug is. The title lives in `status.md` and the HL header, where a person
reads it; the abbreviation inside the identifier is what makes the filename readable without it.

A legacy task keeps `{PREFIX}-{N}`, where the identifier does *not* carry a slug, so its
historical filenames have the form `RES__TFW-60__conflict_resistant_shared_workspace.md`.
Those files are never renamed; the two-part form is history, not a second rule.

#### The revision suffix, and what it generates

**`__rev{N}` is the one suffix the grammar admits, and it is an ordinal.** It names a **revision round** —
repair of what was already specified, ordered after a 🔄 REVISE (§5). It is admitted where a title suffix
is refused, and the reason is the rule above read once more: a title duplicates what `status.md` already
holds, so it makes two facts that must agree; an ordinal lives nowhere else, so the filename is its only
home. The bar on title suffixes stands exactly as written.

- **The unsuffixed file is revision 1, and is never renamed.** No retroactive rename, ever.
- **The highest ordinal governs** — the live order, and the live verdict. Stated here so that two files
  can never both be live.
- **One line generates the four rules below:** *sibling where exactly one must govern; appended where the
  record is cumulative.*

| Artifact | Form | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **TS** | **sibling** | Exactly one order is in force, and the highest ordinal is it |
| **REVIEW** | **sibling** | Exactly one verdict is live, and the highest ordinal is it |
| **RF** | **appended** — one new numbered subsection per round, in every section the round touches | It is the highest-authority artifact and the rejected version must stay openable. Measured cause: `PROPOSAL__TFW-58__revise_protocol` — *"the TS was overwritten in place; revisions 2 → 3 → 4 recorded only as header prose — no way to diff what the executor was told between rounds"* |
| **ONB** | **appended, never a sibling** | Nothing about an ONB governs: it records what an executor understood on entry, and a second entry extends that record. **One ONB file per task** |

**A live revision is amended in place and says so in its header; a superseded one is never touched.** The
never-edited rule protects history, not the order currently in force — an order that cannot absorb a
correction is an order nobody can raise a question against.

> **Rule:** ALL artifact filenames MUST include the task ID or Phase identifier. A filename
> without either is an error.

### Discovery

`{first container}/00-INDEX.md` is a **derived** portfolio view, generated by
`.tfw/scripts/gen_index.py` from task state. It declares that it is derived, names its source
count and its freshness, and reports every legacy, malformed or unresolved input rather than
dropping it.

It is never authoritative. A workflow acting on a selected task **re-reads that task's
`status.md` first**. Absent, stale or malformed, the index degrades discovery and changes no
task state — the project stays workable and says visibly that the view is behind.

The `00-` prefix is a hint at position, not a promise: file managers that group directories
before files place the year folders above it. The guaranteed entry point is the route in the
root `README.md`.

**A directory the identifier grammar does not match is reported, never described.** It goes
to `Unresolved inputs` with a reason stating what is observable — the name — and nothing
about whether work happened there. It is never classified as backlog: a real corpus had two
such directories holding completed HL, TS and RF traces, and a generated artifact called them
*"ideas, not work in progress"*. Silently dropping an input is bad; confidently misdescribing
one is worse, because it reads as a finding. The grammar is not widened to admit the
directory either — that would be an identifier-rule change. An accountable person may rename
it by hand, which leaves a trace; a tool that normalized it would not.

### Where the tooling lives

`.tfw/scripts/` — **inside the payload**, because a project that receives TFW receives
`.tfw/` and nothing else. Rules that require a tool the payload does not carry are rules a
receiving project cannot follow, and `/tfw-update` copies `.tfw/`.

The tools find the project root by walking upward for a `.tfw/` directory, so a project may
place them anywhere. Nothing depends on their depth. Every run prints the root it resolved.

One command answers *is this project consistent with the release it declares*:
`python .tfw/scripts/gen_index.py --check project`. It reports and exits — it repairs
nothing, writes nothing, is authority over nothing, and its output names what it did not
check. The three checks share one flag and differ by subject: `--check index` (is the derived
view current), `--check tasks` (is each task's own state legal — the build gate), `--check
project`.

### A major release ships a migration guide

`.tfw/migrations/{major}.md`, and `update.md` routes to it when an update crosses a major
version. **A major release without one is incomplete.** Prose inside a CHANGELOG that
documents the framework repository's *own* migration is a record, not a procedure: it names
that repository's paths, counts and decisions, and a receiving project cannot follow it.

The guide is written for a project that is not this one, and it states its ordering
constraints where a reader is about to violate them rather than in a summary.

### Commit Attribution

Every AI-authored commit MUST use `[agent/task/scope/role] summary`: set `agent` to the lowercase AI product name from explicit context, `task` to the canonical TFW task ID (`project` only when none exists), `scope` to the established lowercase work-slice slug or a lowercase hyphenated form of its explicit label, and `role` to the lowercase canonical TFW workflow owner from §15/Role Lock; keep `summary` short and imperative, commit locally, and push only after explicit user approval.

Example: `[codex/TFW-50/task/coordinator] define minimal commit attribution`

### Research subfolder

Research artifacts live in a single `research/` container at task root. Each iteration gets its own numbered subfolder:

```
{task}/research/
  iterations.yaml              ← control file
  iter1/
    1_briefing.md              ← numbered stage files
    2_gather.md
    3_extract.md
    4_challenge.md
    RES.md                     ← synthesis co-located with stages
  iter2/
    1_briefing.md
    2_gather.md
    3_extract.md
    4_challenge.md
    RES.md
```

File existence = stage completion. Stage file format: see `.tfw/templates/research/` (`1_briefing.md`, `2_gather.md`, `3_extract.md`, `4_challenge.md`).

#### Multi-iteration research

When research spans multiple iterations, each iteration gets its own subfolder and RES:

| Iteration | Stage files folder | RES file |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | `research/iter1/` | `research/iter1/RES.md` |
| 2 | `research/iter2/` | `research/iter2/RES.md` |
| N | `research/iterN/` | `research/iterN/RES.md` |

**Trace rule:** Iteration folders accumulate — never delete or overwrite previous iteration's files. Each `research/iterN/` folder is a trace. Deleting them = deleting reasoning.

**Control file:** `research/iterations.yaml` tracks iteration state. Created by coordinator in `plan.md` Step 6 before launching research. Format:

```yaml
task_id: PROJ-N
title: research focus description
min_iterations: 2       # from tfw.research.min_iterations or coordinator override
max_iterations: 5       # soft ceiling
iterations:
  - number: 1
    focus: "initial investigation of H1-H3"
    hypotheses: [H1, H2, H3]
    status: complete     # pending | in_progress | complete
    res_file: research/iter1/RES.md
    # agent: antigravity           # optional — which tool/agent ran this iteration
    # sources: [external, codebase] # optional — what sources were consulted
  - number: 2
    focus: "deepen findings from iter 1, test H4"
    hypotheses: [H4]
    status: pending
    res_file: research/iter2/RES.md
```

The `agent` field records which tool or agent conducted the iteration — for traceability, not dispatch. The `sources` field records what source categories were consulted. Both fields are optional; simple single-agent tasks can omit them.

Coordinator updates `research/iterations.yaml` after each iteration (marks status, adds next iteration if needed). Researcher reads it at start to understand predecessor context and assigned hypotheses.


### Review subfolder

Review stage files (`review/map.md`, `review/verify.md`, `review/judge.md`) — intermediate review traces written during the review process. Created in task phase directory. Parallels research stage files (`research/iterN/1_briefing.md`, etc.). The REVIEW artifact synthesizes these files. Stage file format: see `.tfw/templates/review/` (map.md, verify.md, judge.md).

### Evidence subfolder

Every task directory (or phase directory for multi-phase tasks) MUST contain an `evidence/` subfolder. The subfolder always contains at least one structured EV file (`EV__{ID}.md` or `EV__phase-{x}__{title}.md`). Additional binary artifacts (screenshots, API responses, logs) go into the same `evidence/` folder and are indexed in the EV file's Attachments section. Template: `.tfw/templates/evidence/EV.md`.

### Multi-phase folder structure

For multi-phase tasks, master artifacts (HL, RES) stay at task root. Each phase gets a subfolder:

```
{container}/2026/20260826-143000__query_redesign/
  status.md                           ← Live state — the authority for this task
  journal/                            ← One immutable file per event
    20260826-143000__created__saubakirov.md
    20260901-091500__handoff__saubakirov.md
  HL-20260826-143000__query_redesign.md   ← Master HL
  research/                           ← Master research (if any)
  phase-a/
    HL__phase-a__data_model.md
    TS__phase-a__data_model.md
    ONB__phase-a__data_model.md
    RF__phase-a__data_model.md
    REVIEW__phase-a__data_model.md
    evidence/                         ← Mandatory evidence folder
      EV__phase-a__data_model.md      ← Structured evidence file
  phase-b/
    HL__phase-b__api_layer.md
    ...
```

                                                                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                                                                    🔄 REVISE          ❌ REJECT
                                                                (routed by rung)  (user decides)
                    (skip: 📝 HL_DRAFT ··· 🟡 TS_DRAFT)        ↓
                                                           ❌ BLOCKED

  from any status ──→ ❌ REJECTED     terminal · no edge leads out · the trace is kept
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⬜ TODO | Task planned, HL not started |
| 📝 HL_DRAFT | HL being drafted, awaiting review/approval |
| 🔬 RES | Research in progress (optional — user can skip to TS_DRAFT) |
| 🧩 PHASES | The task is multi-phase and its phases are running. **A task-level rollup of phase state is prohibited** — each phase carries its own `status.md`, and a summary would be a second fact that must agree with them |
| 🟡 TS_DRAFT | TS written, awaiting approval for execution |
| 🟠 ONB | Onboarding: executor studying the task |
| 🟢 RF | Execution complete, RF written |
| 🔍 REV | Review: reviewer checking RF |
| 📚 KNW | Knowledge capture: tfw-docs + tfw-knowledge applied (optional — reviewer can pre-close with N/A) |
| ✅ DONE | Task closed, traces updated |
| ❌ BLOCKED | Blocked by dependency |
| ❌ REJECTED | Task closed unsuccessfully and permanently. Distinct from ❌ BLOCKED, which is waiting and resumes when the dependency clears. Terminal: no status follows it, and the task folder and its board row are never deleted. This is a task status — not the review verdict ❌ REJECT, and not the HL §12 amendment verdict ❌ REJECTED; neither of those is terminal |

Status lives in the task's own `status.md` and nowhere else. A transition is one write, inside
one task directory — which is what lets two tasks advance at the same time without their
authors meeting in a shared file. The lifecycle value must be one of the ids above, or
`UNDECLARED` carrying the source value verbatim (→ glossary.md).

**`UNDECLARED`: migration never normalizes, an accountable owner may resolve.** Two different
acts, and reading the prohibition as absolute leaves projects with only bad options — strand
the task where every consumer treats it as non-actionable, or fix it with no trace.

| Act | Permitted |
|---|---|
| A tool rewriting `UNDECLARED` to a declared value | **Never.** It has no basis for the choice, and the rewrite is silent |
| The task's owner setting the correct value **and recording a `transition` event carrying `from: UNDECLARED`** | **Yes.** A person has a basis, and the event is what makes it a trace instead of a silent edit |

The same shape governs a directory name the grammar rejects (→ Discovery): the tool reports,
a person may resolve, and the resolution leaves a record.

### A phase carries its own state

A task with phase directories carries one `status.md` **inside each phase directory**, on the
same closed schema — nothing new is learned in order to read it. Its owner is that phase's
owner, and two phases running under two owners write two different files.

**The task-level `lifecycle` never summarizes phase state.** A rollup is a fact that has to
agree with other files, which is exactly the synchronization problem the carrier already
forbids: two files that must agree is what previously required an engine to solve. The task
file describes the task's own arc and nothing more:

```
TODO → HL_DRAFT → RES → 🧩 PHASES → KNW → DONE
```

While `PHASES` stands, *which* phase is where is answered by reading that phase's own state —
which is the same answer the board's per-phase columns used to give, without a shared table.

A phase state file is created when its phase directory is created, never in advance.

**A phase carries its own `journal/` too**, on the same grammar and the same rules. The
symmetry is the whole point: a reader who knows a phase directory holds its own state does not
have to learn a second rule to find its events. An external project created `phase-a/journal/`
by assuming exactly this before it was implemented, and the assumption was right — two of that
project's malformed events sat there while a gate that read only the task's own journal
reported clean over them. Every consumer reads every journal a task holds.

A material transition is also recorded as a journal event, so the *why* survives the session
that decided it. The state file says where the task is; the journal says how it got there.

Review verdicts:
- ✅ **APPROVE** — all ok → 📚 KNW (run tfw-docs + tfw-knowledge), then ✅ DONE
- 🔄 **REVISE** — specific issues → 🟡 TS_DRAFT while the coordinator writes the round's order, then
  🟠 ONB when the executor takes it. Each item is routed by **rung** (below)
- ❌ **REJECT** → 🛑 User decides: (a) 📝 HL_DRAFT (rework HL), (b) 🔬 RES (new research), (c) 🟡 TS_DRAFT (rewrite TS)

> **Branch (a) does not thaw the contract.** For an HL that is 🔒 FROZEN, "rework HL" means *file an
> amendment against the frozen sections* — a §12 row per change, with evidence, cost and an
> alternative, awaiting an owner verdict. Re-entry to `📝 HL_DRAFT` reopens the free sections only;
> a rejection is not a re-approval and does not unlock §1, §3, §4, §5, §6 or §7. Without this,
> REJECT is the one documented path that reopens frozen sections with no proposal and no log.
> Rules: §3 → HL Contract.

#### The 🔄 REVISE route

A rung is a property of the **item**; `lifecycle` is a property of the **task**. One REVISE ordinarily
carries items of both rungs, so a rung is delivered beside its item and never by a lifecycle value.

| Rung | What the fix must change | Where the item goes | What moves |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | nothing outside the approved TS | back to execution, same task | nothing — the majority case costs no escalation |
| 2 | the TS | `pending — coordinator` in the REVIEW row, beside the item | `lifecycle: 🟡 TS_DRAFT`, **only when the TS is actually changed** — one act per round, whatever the item count |
| 3 | a frozen HL claim | an `amendment_escalated` event plus an HL §12 row, to the owner | nothing else may move it — rules 3 and 8 above |

Rung 2 exists because a reviewer holding a finding only the coordinator can discharge otherwise has no
door that is not REJECT, and writes it into a list only the executor reads — who may not amend a TS.

**A revision, and what it is not.** A **revision** is repair of what was already specified: a new TS for
an approved phase, or a correction to the existing one. It is not a review round, and it is not new work —
only a change of the task's **declared outcome** is that. The test is not *"can the existing TS accept
it"*: a rung-2 finding fails that by construction.

**The citation bar, and the return.** A round may order only items that **name the condition each
breaches** — an acceptance criterion of the approved TS, or a frozen HL claim. Everything else is
disposed of. When nothing can be cited the verdict is ✅ APPROVE with the remainder disposed. A reviewer
who can neither cite nor approve **stops the work** and returns it to the `owner` handle in the task's
`status.md`, recorded as a `transition` to ❌ BLOCKED naming *no basis can be stated* as the blocker.
`owner` may be `type: human` or `type: agent`, and an agent applies this same rule upward to reach its
own human or a higher agent. Where `owner` is `unassigned`, the return is a hard stop naming that as the
blocker: work cannot be returned toward nobody.

**Why it returns rather than being ruled here.** A loop that cannot close is evidence about the HL or the
research behind it, and that diagnosis is outside what the agents in the loop can see — they are the ones
who could not close it. Every round may be correcting real work while the loop is still reporting a
badly-posed task. This is the only point at which the protocol calls anyone out of the loop, and that is
what pays for not calling them anywhere else.

**The round cycle, drawn once.** Each role writes into its own artifact, and the round is readable by
listing the task directory.

```text
  REVIEW__{ID}.md          §4 🔄 REVISE · items are PROPOSALS · the work returns to the coordinator
        │                  reviewer writes · lifecycle → 🟡 TS_DRAFT
        ▼
  TS__{ID}__rev2.md        the order: the round, who ordered it, each item's BASIS, and its approval
        │                  coordinator writes · a sibling · the highest ordinal governs
        ▼
  RF__{ID}.md              one new numbered subsection per round, in every section the round touches
        │                  executor appends · nothing overwritten · lifecycle → 🟠 ONB → 🟢 RF
        ▼
  REVIEW__{ID}__rev2.md    reviewer of the round · a sibling · the highest ordinal is the live verdict
        │
        ├─► ✅ APPROVE                       → 📚 KNW
        ├─► 🔄 REVISE, a condition cited     → the cycle again, at rev3
        └─► no basis can be stated           → ❌ BLOCKED, returned to the task's `owner`
```

**Who takes the round is deliberately not regulated.** The order may go to the same executor or to a fresh
one, and the same for the reviewer — because if a fresh executor cannot carry out the round from the
artifacts alone, the order is incomplete. Continuity of context is an optimization whoever dispatches may
take; requiring it would move state into a session, and sessions do not persist.

## 6) Scope Budgets (per Phase)

> Configured in `.tfw/project_config.yaml` (`tfw.scope_budgets`).
> Values below are defaults. Override in project_config.yaml for your project.

| Parameter | Default | Rationale | Config key |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Files per phase | 50 | Agent maintains full context of changed files | `max_files_per_phase` |
| New files per phase | 50 | Limits blast radius of new abstractions | `max_new_files` |
| LOC per phase | 5000 | Keeps changes reviewable in one pass | `max_loc` |
| Modified files | 50 | Prevents scattered, hard-to-review diffs | `max_modified_files` |

## 7) Execution Modes

### CL (Chat Loop) — default
- AI proposes steps, human approves/executes.
- AI does NOT execute external actions without approval.

### AG (Autonomous) — explicit request only
- AI works independently within approved TS scope.
- Makes incremental commits.
- Stops when encountering issues not covered by TS.

## 8) Workflows

TFW defines the following canonical workflows in `.tfw/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Role | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| [init.md](workflows/init.md) | Coordinator | Discover project → interview → knowledge → setup → verify |
| [plan.md](workflows/plan.md) | Coordinator | Research → HL → RESEARCH gate → scope decision → TS |
| [research/base.md](workflows/research/base.md) | Researcher | Structured investigation → RES artifact (pipeline or standalone) |
| [handoff.md](workflows/handoff.md) | Executor | Context load → ONB → execute → RF |
| [review.md](workflows/review.md) | Reviewer | Read RF → checklist → verdict → debt disposed → traces |
| [resume.md](workflows/resume.md) | Coordinator | Locate task → status matrix → decide next phase |
| [docs.md](workflows/docs.md) | Coordinator | Update KNOWLEDGE.md after task completion |
| [knowledge.md](workflows/knowledge.md) | Coordinator | Consolidate fact candidates into verified project knowledge (Orient → Gather → Consolidate → Prune) |
| [release.md](workflows/release.md) | Coordinator | Read RELEASE.md → scope release → version bump → CHANGELOG → tag |
| [update.md](workflows/update.md) | Coordinator | Fetch upstream → compare versions → categorize changes → update checklist → re-sync adapters |
| [config.md](workflows/config.md) | Coordinator | Interactive config change → propagate to all inline values |

## 9) Tool Adapter Pattern

`.tfw/` is the tool-agnostic core — one copy per project. Each development tool reads its own entry point, which references `.tfw/`:

```
CLAUDE.md ──→ "Read .tfw/README.md, follow .tfw/conventions.md"
.cursor/rules ──→ "Read .tfw/README.md, follow .tfw/conventions.md"
.agent/rules ──→ "Read .tfw/README.md, follow .tfw/conventions.md"
AGENTS.md + .agents/skills/tfw-*/SKILL.md ──→ Codex `/tfw-*` command routing
```

Adapters are chosen at project init. See `.tfw/quickstart.md` for setup.

**An adapter installs whole copies or marker-bounded blocks, and nothing of a third kind.** A
whole copy — a command, a workflow, a rule file, a skill — is verified by `cmp` against its
source. Where TFW content is merged into a **project-owned** file — the `TFW:CLAUDE` block in
`CLAUDE.md`, the `TFW:CODEX` block in `AGENTS.md` — the managed text sits between
`<!-- TFW:{NAME}:START -->` and `<!-- TFW:{NAME}:END -->` and is verified on that region alone.
One rule governs every such block, in every adapter:

| The target file… | The sync… |
|---|---|
| carries the markers | replaces the text between them and touches nothing outside |
| does not exist | is created from the template, block included |
| exists **without** markers | is **reported and left untouched** — the operator inserts the block once, and every later sync is mechanical |

Appending a block to a file that already carries an unmarked, hand-written TFW section produces
two sections that disagree; no adapter guesses where the content "probably is". Exactly one
managed block per file. `update.md` Step 6 names which row is a copy and which is a block.

For Codex, `/tfw-*` is the primary human-facing command contract. Root `AGENTS.md`
provides always-on recognition and fallback routing; repository-local skills provide
discoverability and progressive workflow loading. Skills are implementation, not a
separate wrapper users must learn. Adapter source lives in `.tfw/adapters/codex/` and
installed copies live in `.agents/skills/tfw-*/`.

## 10) Context Loading Order (new session, strict)

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.tfw/conventions.md`, `.tfw/glossary.md`
3. `KNOWLEDGE.md` (if exists)
4. Relevant HL/TS/RF for the current task

## 10.1) Fact Categories

> Universal categories for Fact Candidates. Open list — agents can use custom categories when none fit.

| Category | Scope | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `environment` | Where the work lives | servers, tools, platforms, classrooms, labs, hosting |
| `process` | How work gets done, business processes | schedules, approvals, reporting cadence, grading cycles |
| `stakeholder` | Who needs what | priorities, pain points, expectations, quotes, key decisions |
| `constraint` | What limits exist | contractual obligations, regulatory deadlines, resource caps, technical limits |
| `convention` | Agreed standards | naming, style, format, language, tone |
| `domain` | Subject matter knowledge | revenue patterns, client segments, market metrics, business rules, curriculum |
| `context` | Background that shapes decisions | market conditions, competitive landscape, regulatory changes, prior decisions |
| `risk` | Known dangers | client concentration, market dependency, knowledge silos, fragile dependencies |
| `philosophy` | Values, principles, vision | design rationale, methodology beliefs, north star decisions, "why we do it this way" |

## 10.2) Knowledge Infrastructure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `knowledge/` | Project root folder for topic files (per-category verified facts) |
| `knowledge/{category}.md` | Topic file — verified facts for a category. Template: `.tfw/templates/knowledge/topic.md` |
| `.tfw/knowledge_state.yaml` | Consolidation tracking: last seq, date, statistics |
| `.tfw/workflows/knowledge.md` | 4-phase consolidation workflow (Orient → Gather → Consolidate → Prune) |
| `tfw.knowledge` in project_config.yaml | Configurable limits: interval, gate_mode, max_index_lines, max_facts_per_topic, max_topic_files |

## 10.3) File Classification in `.tfw/`

`.tfw/` contains three categories of files with different lifecycle rules:

| Category | Files | Init | Update | Owner |
|----------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| **Framework** | workflows/, templates/, conventions.md, glossary.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, VERSION, compilable_contract.md, quickstart.md, adapters/ | Copy from upstream | Overwrite/merge from upstream | Upstream repo |
| **State** | knowledge_state.yaml | Create from template | **NEVER** overwrite | Project (tfw-knowledge) |
| **Config** | project_config.yaml | Create from template → fill project values | Merge: framework sections update, project sections preserve | Project + upstream |

**Templates** for state and config files: `.tfw/templates/knowledge_state.yaml`, `.tfw/templates/project_config.yaml`.

**Rule:** `init.md` and `update.md` MUST respect these categories. State files are NEVER sourced from upstream — only from templates.

## 10.4) File Naming Convention

**Two rules, and which one applies is decided by what the file is, not by where it sits.**

**1 — A template carries the name of the artifact it produces.** `HL.md` produces an HL,
`RF.md` an RF, `EV.md` an EV. The artifact's name is a term of the method, and a template that
renamed it would make the reader translate between two spellings of one thing.

```
templates/HL.md · TS.md · RF.md · RES.md · ONB.md · REVIEW.md · KNOWLEDGE.md
templates/RELEASE.md · evidence/EV.md
```

**2 — Everything else in `.tfw/` is `lower_snake_case`**: configuration, state, and any
template whose output is not a named artifact.

```
project_config.yaml   not PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml
knowledge_state.yaml  not KNOWLEDGE_STATE.yaml
templates/status.md · journal/event.md · team/profile.md · knowledge/topic.md
templates/research/1_briefing.md   numeric prefix where stage order is part of the name
```

Uppercase remains reserved for project-root documents — `README.md`, `KNOWLEDGE.md`,
`AGENTS.md` — and for `.tfw/` framework docs, `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`.

**A template producing into a directory lives in a directory of that name**, mirroring its
output: `templates/journal/event.md` → `{task}/journal/<name>.md`. An underscore standing in
for a directory separator — a `journal_event` shape rather than `journal/event` — is what
this rule replaced.

> **Why this is stated as two rules rather than one.** Until `2.0.0-dirty.3` §10.4 said every
> Markdown template follows `lower_snake_case`, and **nine of its own twenty subjects
> contradicted it** — every artifact template did. Its single illustration was
> a `topic_file` template a move had already deleted, so the one example it offered named a
> file the payload no longer shipped. Swapping that example for a surviving filename was the
> available small fix and it was refused: it would have left a rule wrong about nine of the
> files it governs, and a rule nobody follows teaches the reader to distrust the ones that
> are true. What was wrong was the rule.

## 11) Quality Standard (no compromises)

- No placeholders.
- Results must be usable without manual edits.
- If a result is wrong — fix the prompt/context and retry until quality is met.
- Tasks are atomic and human-verifiable.
- **Content Language:** Template structure (headings, labels, field names) is always English.
  Artifact content is filled in the language specified by `tfw.content_language` in project_config.yaml.
  Default: `en`. Agent MUST check this value before writing artifacts.

### Design Rules

- **Token density**: workflow instructions ≤1200 words. Templates own format; workflows reference templates
- **Inline enforcement**: enforcement-critical values MUST be inline (Pattern A: defaults + config key). Pure refs (Pattern B) = broken
- **DNA/Library**: Role Lock + Mindset = always inline. Reference data = via ref-inside-step. Step self-contained, ref adds precision
- **Progressive Disclosure**: agent loads only what it needs now. Mode files loaded at Step 2, not at start
- **A command written into a workflow must survive its adapter.** No `$0`–`$9` and no `$ARGUMENTS` in any
  shell or `awk` snippet a role is meant to run: an adapter harness substitutes those in command text
  **before** the agent reads it, so the copy is byte-identical to its source and still arrives mangled.
  Named shell variables are untouched and are the way to hold a value. Measured: `review.md`'s debt
  search reached its first real reviewer with both `$0` occurrences replaced by the invocation argument,
  and `cmp` was green throughout — the fidelity check cannot see this class, because nothing was copied
  wrong. Write the snippet without `$N` (`awk` matches the record implicitly; `sub(/^/, …); print` needs
  no field reference) and run it once from the project root before shipping it

## 12) Safety and Execution Honesty

- In CL mode, never claim something was "run" or "tested" outside the session.
- Never request secrets in plain text. Use environment variables.
- Evidence requires real-environment observation — deploying, opening, running, or viewing completed work in conditions beyond the build/test toolchain. VERIFIED status requires an artifact reference (file path or inline output).

## 13) Trace Discipline

Every task produces an **RF file** with results, decisions and observations, a **`status.md`** carrying its live state, and a **`journal/`** recording the events that moved it. Together with the derived portfolio index, these form the project's memory across sessions — and because each lives inside its own task, two tasks can advance without their traces colliding.

Debt found in a review is part of that trace and lives in the REVIEW that found it, disposed of before the task closes. There is no project-level debt registry: the one that existed was retired at 2.1.0 and its rows are history in `tasks/DEBT-SNAPSHOT.md`.

Reverting a result does not revert its trace. A rejected task's folder and its board row are never deleted: the work may leave the working tree, the record that the work happened stays.

## 14) Anti-patterns (prohibited)

- Executor starts coding before all blocking questions resolved
- Executor skips reading HL and goes straight to code
- Coordinator skips review and closes without REVIEW file
- RF file doesn't mention test results or observations
- TS is written without an approved HL
- Executor modifies Master HL without coordinator approval
- Executor makes architectural decisions not in HL
- Executor modifies files outside TS scope (even "obvious fixes")
- Executor does "bonus fixes" without documenting in RF deviations
- Executor writes RF before build/lint passes
- Executor sees tech debt / dead code but doesn't report in Observations
- Coordinator ignores executor Observations — every surviving one is recorded in REVIEW §5 and disposed of there
- Coordinator writes ONB, RF, or implements code → **Role Lock violation**
- Executor writes HL, TS, or changes scope → **Role Lock violation**
- Executor writes REVIEW file → **Role Lock violation**
- Reviewer approves without opening any files — Step 2 (Verify) requires spot-checking RF claims against actual artifacts
- A review checklist row is added without an evidenced firing rate — a row that cannot produce a finding is ceremony, and without a measured rate "it might catch something" is unfalsifiable. A row may be kept on consequence rather than frequency (a rare failure with asymmetric cost), and that reason must be written into the row
- Executor omits RF §7-9 (Fact Candidates, Strategic Insights, Diagrams) — sections are mandatory; empty content ("No X.") is valid, absent section is not
- Researcher omits Findings Map in RES — section is mandatory; "No findings map." is valid if genuinely no visualization relevant
- Coordinator reads KNOWLEDGE.md in context loading but never cites relevant items in HL §4 — "read but don't use" pattern breaks cross-task knowledge flow
- TS contains ready-made implementation — TS §5 must contain acceptance criteria (WHAT), not code or steps (HOW); implementation belongs to executor
- Coordinator reads own TS instead of RF when planning next phase — before writing TS for Phase N, read RF of the latest completed phase; plan ≠ fact
- Executor writes RF without opening template — RF template must be opened before writing; writing from memory drifts from required structure
- Coordinator answers ONB questions without source — when uncertain, present options and context, not decisions on behalf of the stakeholder
- Executor marks evidence VERIFIED without artifact reference in `evidence/` folder — assertion without evidence
- Executor marks evidence N/A without justification from TS Evidence field or documented reason
- Executor writes RF §5 Evidence before actually collecting evidence — evidence must be contemporaneous, not reconstructed
- Reviewer approves RF without checking that evidence artifact references resolve to real files or inline output
- Executor marks evidence DEFERRED without naming the specific blocker (missing environment, unavailable device, pending deployment)
- Anyone edits a frozen HL section without a §12 row carrying a logged owner verdict — the silent contract edit the amendment channel exists to replace
- Researcher submits HL recommendations without classifying each row as a refinement or an amendment proposal — one undifferentiated channel is how "risk probability is Medium" and "drop Phase B" arrive together
- Coordinator applies an amendment before its verdict — the proposal and the change become the same act, and the owner rules on something already done
- Research starts on an uncommitted approved HL — the baseline cannot be diffed, so drift becomes documented and permanently unverifiable
- Any role treats a remark inside a research thread, a review or a chat as an amendment verdict — a comment is input, a verdict is a distinct recorded act
- An agent cites its own delegation as authority to accept a scope or budget overrun — a mandate is a ceiling, and authority that extends itself is not authority
- A Phase HL authors its own acceptance criteria, failure conditions, vision or principles — a second, unapproved contract one level below the one that was ruled on
- A reviewer approves work that satisfies the TS but not the approved contract or the north star — the TS is downstream of any drift, so a green review against it can only confirm the drift
- A reviewer asserts alignment without citing the clause it serves — an unciteable claim is indistinguishable from a fabricated one, and a citation that resolves while being irrelevant is the same defect one layer in
- A whole-tree restore reverts task state past a task's failure status — restoring every file to an older tree also restores state files to a state that never contained the newer ones, so the loss happens silently and nobody decides it
- A workflow acts on a task using the derived index instead of re-reading that task's `status.md` — the index may be stale by construction, and acting on it makes a projection authoritative
- A task directory is moved to express its status, or corrected into a different year folder — the year is the year of creation, and a move breaks every reference that already resolves
- An identifier is allocated by reading a project-wide maximum, a counter or another task's directory — that read is exactly what makes two offline participants collide
- A journal event is edited or deleted after it was written — a correction is a new event; rewriting one erases the record the journal exists to keep
- A journal event copies HL, RES, TS, RF, REVIEW, evidence or chat text instead of referencing it — this is how the journal becomes the next unbounded shared file
- A status value outside the declared vocabulary is normalized into one that is inside it — the listing looks tidier and a recorded fact has been silently rewritten
- Identity is inferred from an OS username, hostname, folder name or account display string — a machine does not know who is sitting at it, and the guess becomes a durable attribution nobody made
- A per-user file is kept on the shared tree — gitignored is not sync-ignored, so under file synchronization it reaches every participant
- A workflow ships a command containing `$0`–`$9` or `$ARGUMENTS` — an adapter harness rewrites it before the agent reads it, the copy passes `cmp` because nothing was copied wrong, and the role receives a command that cannot run
- A task closes with a captured debt item undisposed, or with a disposition that names something not yet in existence — *"→ backlog"*, *"someone should open a task"*, *"the next scripts pass"*. Both restore the deferred queue that filled the retired registry, and the second is harder to see because it reads like a decision
- A project-level debt list is reintroduced under another name — a second registry, a per-task debt file, a generated backlog view. The channel was closed deliberately; reopening it under a new word is the failure the retirement exists to prevent
- Work is left unfinished on the ground that it can be recorded as debt — deferral is not a way to finish, and no artifact offers it as one
- A rung-2 finding is written into the REVISE list only the executor reads — the executor may not amend a TS, so the item returns unchanged every round. Measured: one task returned *"obtain coordinator amendments"* in rev2, rev3 and rev4 and no amendment was ever logged, while the same reviewer's next surface addressed the item to the coordinator and closed at rev3
- A 🔄 REVISE orders an item that names no breached condition — the citation bar, §5. A round is reachable while a condition can be cited and not otherwise; when none can be, the verdict is ✅ APPROVE with the remainder disposed, or the work stops and returns to the task's `owner`, and an `unassigned` owner is a hard stop naming itself as the blocker. A loop that cannot close is evidence about the HL, and the agents inside it are the ones who could not close it

### 14.1 Terminology Origin (maintainer reference)

The following terms used in research stage templates are TFW-native and intentionally avoid methodology names:

| TFW Term | Meaning | Origin |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Dimension | An independent decision factor (degree of freedom) in the problem | Zwicky's GMA: "parameter" |
| Alternative | One valid value for a Dimension | Zwicky's GMA: "parameter value" |
| Configuration Space | The full cross-product of all Dimension alternatives | Zwicky's GMA: "morphological box" |
| Consistency Check | Pairwise incompatibility analysis eliminating invalid combinations | Zwicky's GMA: "cross-consistency assessment (CCA)" |
| Surviving Configuration | A configuration that passed all pairwise checks | Zwicky's GMA: "compatible solution" |

> **Scope:** This note is for framework maintainers only. The terms "Zwicky", "GMA", "General Morphological Analysis", "morphological box", and "cross-consistency assessment" MUST NOT appear in any researcher-facing template or workflow instruction.

## 15) Role Lock Protocol

Each workflow declares a **🔒 ROLE LOCK** at the top. The agent MUST refuse any action outside the locked role.

**Acceptance authority is named here, not only in the workflow that exercises it.** Deciding whether new
work exists is acceptance authority and belongs to the Coordinator; a reviewer that ruled it would be
deciding the consequences of its own findings. Ordering work *inside* an approved TS is not acceptance
authority — that is the rung-1 route in §5, and it needs no coordinator.

| Workflow | Role Lock | Permitted Artifacts | Forbidden Artifacts |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `init.md` | Coordinator | RES, RF, project config files | HL, TS, code |
| `plan.md` | Coordinator | HL, TS | ONB, RF, RES, REVIEW, code |
| `research/base.md` | Researcher | RES, research/ stage files | HL, TS, ONB, RF, REVIEW, code |
| `handoff.md` | Executor | ONB, RF, code | HL, TS, RES, REVIEW |
| `review.md` | Reviewer — **marks and proposes**; the **Coordinator** holds acceptance authority over dispositions and rules them once at the close of review (Step 6) | review stage files (map.md, verify.md, judge.md), REVIEW, proposed dispositions | ONB, RF, HL, TS, code, **disposition rulings** |
| `resume.md` | Coordinator | Status matrix, Phase HL, Phase TS | ONB, RF, RES, REVIEW, code |
| `docs.md` | Coordinator | KNOWLEDGE.md | code |
| `release.md` | Coordinator | VERSION, CHANGELOG.md | code |
| `update.md` | Coordinator | `.tfw/` files, adapter copies | code |
| `config.md` | Coordinator | project_config.yaml, workflow files, convention files, adapter copies | code |

### Hard Stop Rule

When a Coordinator reaches the end of planning (TS approved), the correct action is:
1. Inform the user that planning is complete
2. Instruct: "Start `/tfw-handoff` to begin execution"
3. **Do NOT continue into execution**

When an Executor finishes RF, the correct action is:
1. Inform the user that execution is complete
2. Instruct: "Start `/tfw-review` to review the results"
3. **Do NOT write a REVIEW file**

When a Researcher finishes RES, the correct action is:
1. Inform the user that research is complete
2. Instruct: "Continue with `/tfw-plan` to apply research findings"
3. **Do NOT write HL or TS**

When a Reviewer reaches a verdict, the correct action is to **name the next act** — a decision with
no addressee is not a decision:
1. On ✅ APPROVE — inform the user the review is complete, then run the KNW steps (`/tfw-docs`, and
   `/tfw-knowledge` if Fact Candidates exist). `lifecycle: KNW`, not `DONE` yet
2. On 🔄 REVISE — state that the items are **proposals**, say how many, and **return the work to the
   Coordinator**: "Start `/tfw-plan` to order the round." Set `lifecycle: TS_DRAFT`. Do **not** write an
   ordered bound and do **not** dispatch an executor: a round is ordered in the coordinator's own
   artifact, and the reviewer does not own one
3. On ❌ REJECT — route by §5's three destinations and say **which**: (a) 📝 HL_DRAFT, (b) 🔬 RES, or
   (c) 🟡 TS_DRAFT
4. **Do NOT fix anything yourself** — a reviewer that repairs its own findings has reviewed nothing

When a Coordinator receives work returned by a 🔄 REVISE, the correct action is:
1. Order the round in **your own artifact** — a TS revision. The two writes and what they contain are
   `plan.md`'s numbered post-review step, stated there and not here
2. Instruct: "Start `/tfw-handoff` to work the round"
3. **Do NOT execute the round yourself** — ordering is not doing, and the boundary is the one the Hard
   Stop at the end of planning already holds
