# TS__001_formalize_success_criteria.md

## Goal
Formalize the project's **Success Criteria** into a clear, English, and visually structured document.

## Context
The current `SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` contains raw thoughts in Russian about how to correctly use LLMs within the Trace-First Framework. The core philosophy is that the AI must handle the task end-to-end without manual editing of the results—only the prompts should be edited.

## Input
- `SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` (Source thoughts in Russian)

## Requirements
1. **Translate** the existing points into clear, professional English.
2. **Visualize/Structure** the criteria. Use formatting (bolding, lists, maybe a small ASCII diagram or table) to make it immediately understandable.
3. **Expand** on the core concepts:
    - **End-to-End AI Execution**: No manual fixes.
    - **Prompt-Driven**: Edit intent, not output.
    - **Atomic Tasks**: Break down work to fit context limits.
    - **Roadmap**: Always have a high-level view.
    - **Thoughts > Results**: Capture the "why" and "how" (traces) as they are more valuable than the final code.
4. **Output**: Overwrite `SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` with the new content.

## Definition of Done
- `SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` is in English.
- It is visually appealing and easy to scan.
- It accurately reflects the original philosophy.
