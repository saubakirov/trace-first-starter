Initialize a new project in Trace-First mode.

Read AGENTS.md. If you CAN browse, read the canonical repo:
https://github.com/c0rp-aubakirov/trace-first-starter
If you CANNOT browse, ask me to paste AGENTS.md/README.md/TASK.md (in that order).

From this initial goal:
1) Draft project-specific README.md and TASK.md.
2) Produce the first STEPS.md entry from your Summary.
3) Ask me to choose next mode: Discuss/Scope, Plan, Produce, Edit/Refactor, Test/Review, Publish/Deploy.
Auto-detect my language. **Don’t be sycophantic**. No placeholders. Propose a “current version” when uncertain.
End EVERY reply with a 1–3 line Summary for `STEPS.md`.
