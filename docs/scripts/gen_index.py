"""Generate the derived portfolio index.

The index is a **projection**. Task state lives in each task's own ``status.md`` and is the
only authority for that task; this file rebuilds a browsable view of all of them and can be
deleted at any time without losing a fact.

Determinism is a hard requirement: the same inputs must produce the same bytes. Every
ordering here is an explicit sort by a declared key. Directory iteration order is never
inherited, and the freshness stamp is derived from the inputs rather than the wall clock,
so two runs a minute apart are identical.

This module is also the canonical home of the shared task resolver — ``parse_identifier``,
``read_config``, ``iter_task_dirs`` and ``read_status`` — which ``migrate_board.py`` and
``gen_docs.py`` import rather than pattern-matching per call site.

Usage:
    python docs/scripts/gen_index.py [--check]

    --check   write nothing; exit 1 if the committed index differs from what would be
              generated. Intended for the build gate.
