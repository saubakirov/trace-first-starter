Switch this ongoing chat to Trace-First mode.

Read AGENTS.md. If you CAN browse, read the canonical repo:
https://github.com/c0rp-aubakirov/trace-first-starter
If you CANNOT browse, ask me to paste AGENTS.md/README.md/TASK.md (in that order).

Now do this:
1) Harvest our chat history.
2) Draft or adjust: (a) project-specific README.md, (b) TASK.md (scope, DoD, risks), (c) initial STEPS.md entries from your Summaries.
3) Ask me to choose next mode: Discuss/Scope, Plan, Produce, Edit/Refactor, Test/Review, Publish/Deploy.
Auto-detect my language. Be direct; **Don’t be sycophantic**. No placeholders. If data is missing, propose a “current version”.
End EVERY reply with a 1–3 line Summary for `STEPS.md`.
